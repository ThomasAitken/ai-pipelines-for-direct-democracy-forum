* How to Formulate a Political Argument *

Steps:
1. Enumerate your Normative Bases: Clearly state the fundamental principles or values that underpin your argument.
2. Clarify any further high-level assumptions: Specify any additional overarching assumptions that are essential to your reasoning.
3. Define any uncommon terms as necessary: Ensure that specialized or uncommon terms are clearly defined to avoid misunderstandings.
4. Present your argument in simple and precise language: Use clear and concise language. Claims with empirical content should be supported by footnotes linking to reliable sources or annotated as a "Judgment."


* Worked Examples *
The following is an example of an argument for the proposition that the government should grant funding to the Direct Democracy Forum. The argument is structured according to the guidelines above.

As long as it is able to attract and keep a strong pool of engaged users, this forum should be able to provide a unique service in producing up-to-date information and analysis on what is actually going on in parliament. The feature of displaying links to other media on each forum should also allow this site to serve as a news distributor and aggregator, thus likely strengthening the broader ecosystem of political discourse. In general, encouraging citizens to engage with politics in terms of concrete policy issues should promote a more intelligent and civil political culture [<a href="/about/argument-guidelines#Judgment">Judgment</a>].</p><p>Among many other secondary benefits we might imagine, one is that this site could become a powerful gauge of public opinion that goes beyond the usual vague polling questions to actually build a map of what people think on a range of concrete policy issues.</p><ol class="footnote-section footnotes" data-footnote-section="" role="doc-endnotes"><li class="footnote-item" data-footnote-item="" data-footnote-index="1" data-footnote-id="aq1upuv6w2f" role="doc-endnote" id="fnaq1upuv6w2f"><span class="footnote-back-link" data-footnote-back-link="" data-footnote-id="aq1upuv6w2f"><sup><strong><a href="#fnrefaq1upuv6w2f">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class="footnote-content" data-footnote-content=""><p>My estimate based on an assumption that I leave my day job and hire a small team.

The following is an example of an argument against the proposition that the government should grant funding to the Direct Democracy Forum. The argument is structured according to the guidelines above.
```
<i>Normative Bases</i><ol><li><a href="/about/normative-bases#SameAsOpponent">Same as Opponent</a></li></ol><p>Let's grant that the Direct Democracy Forum is a good idea. Even if so, the forum is better off getting grassroots funding from its users. The forum does not <i>need</i> government funding.

```

* What is a Judgment? *
When composing an argument, it is sometimes necessary to fall back on claims or contentions that loosely fall under the rubric of "Common Sense". These are not assumptions, derivations or direct empirical claims, but simply plausible judgments. Think the sort of assertion you would usually cloak in language like "I would claim" or "It is plausible to believe that" - something that rings true to you but which you would be hard-pressed to back up with a specific link or citation. As you can see in the Worked Example arguments above, in such cases you should avoid the usual hedging phrases and just make your assertion, plus an extra appendage like so: "[Judgment]". If you do not do this, then an admin will probably come by later and add a "Citation Needed" footnote to this same sentence, which will look worse!

It is also worth considering that you may not need to use a Judgment at all. The more judgments you make, the weaker your argument will be, relative to one that relies on more verifiable claims. So if you can substitute a judgment for a more directly verifiable claim, it is usually a good idea to do so.

NORMATIVE_BASES_DIGEST = """
* What is a "Normative Basis"? *
A normative basis serves as an ethical or legal cornerstone for political arguments. The set of bases that have been curated is designed to achieve comprehensive coverage of possible political arguments with minimal conceptual overlap.

* The Set of Normative Bases: *
    Meta:
        - Same as Opponent: Utilizing the same values as the opposing argument to challenge its reasoning or evidence.
        - Legal Principle: Basing arguments on legal foundations, such as constitutional provisions or international laws.

    Ethical Foundations:
        - Utilitarian Ground Truth: Focusing on actions that maximize overall well-being or minimize harm. (Only to be used in clear-cut cases.)
        - Egalitarianism: Advocating for equality in critical societal aspects like income, wealth, and access to services.
        - Propertarianism: Emphasizing the protection of existing property rights and private wealth.
        - Non-Discrimination: Opposing unequal treatment based on characteristics such as race, gender, or disability.
        - Pro-Democracy: Promoting active civic engagement and democratic governance.
        - Hobbesianism: Highlighting the necessity of authority and power for societal stability.
        - Environmentalism: Prioritizing the preservation and health of natural ecosystems.
        - National Prestige/Patriotism: Valuing the nation's global standing and influence.
        - Virtue of Gallantry/Machismo: Upholding values like honor, courage, and physical prowess.
        - Intellectualism: Esteeming knowledge, scholarship, and educational pursuits.
        - Aestheticism: Valuing the creation and appreciation of beauty, art, and cultural wealth.

CORE_INSTRUCTIONS = """
You will need to fill out the following fields:

* Field 1: the High-level Summary of the Bill *
A statement, in simple language, of the purpose of the bill and what it proposes to change. Make it clear and concise - ideally 1-2 sentences.

If there is any relevant context or background, include it in the optional second paragraph.


* Field 2: the Detailed Summary of the Bill *
Whereas the high-level summary describes the idea of the bill without necessarily referring to specific legislation, this section should briefly describe which legislation is affected and how. There is currently a word limit of 300 words.

If there is a good bill digest or explanatory memo associated with the bill, you may be able to take guidance from it. If copying passages from these sources verbatim, please make sure to attribute and represent them as quotes, e.g. `From the explanatory memo: <blockquote>...</blockquote>`.


* Field 3: the Argument For the Bill *
This field should follow the argument guidelines that you read earlier. It must begin by enumerating appropriate Normative Bases (with hyperlinks) under an italicised heading of this name. This section can be brief if there is not much to say, or longer if there are many reasons to support the bill.


* Field 4: the Argument Against the Bill *
This field should follow the argument guidelines that you read earlier. It must begin by enumerating appropriate Normative Bases (with hyperlinks) under an italicised heading of this name. This section can be brief if there is not much to say, or longer if there are many reasons to oppose the bill.


* Field 5: Categories *
Choose up to 3 categories that best describe the bill from the following list:
```
- Anti-Corruption
- Civics
- Criminal Law Reform
- Family Law Reform
- Education
- Media / Advertising
- Climate Change / Environment
- Democratic Institutions
- Competition Policy
- Consumer Protection
- National Security
- Defence
- Discrimination / Human Rights
- Trade Policy
- Social Support / Welfare
- Poverty
- Labour
- Housing Policy
- Healthcare
- Industrial Policy
- Immigration
- Energy Policy
- Infrastructure
- Foreign Policy
- Financial Regulation
- Agriculture
- Transport
- Science / Technology
- Taxation
- Indigenous
- Fiscal Package (Stimulus / Debt Relief)



Return your answer as a JSON object with the following structure:
```
{
  "high_level_summary": "The bill proposes to...",
  "detailed_summary": "The bill affects...",
  "argument_for": "The bill should be supported because...",
  "argument_against": "The bill should be opposed because...",
  "categories": ["Civics", "Education"]
}
```
Remember that "high_level_summary", "detailed_summary", "argument_for", and "argument_against" should be in HTML, using the same set of tags you have seen in the earlier Worked Example (plus `blockquote` for quotes). Recall that `<ul><li>` will work for bulleted lists and `<ol><li>` for numbered lists, <b> for bold and <u> for underlined. Footnotes should follow the same HTML formatting you saw earlier.

Thank you in advance.

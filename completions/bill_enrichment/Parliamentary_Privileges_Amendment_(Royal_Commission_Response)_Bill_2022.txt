  "high_level_summary": "The bill proposes to amend the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 to exempt certain Royal Commissions from restrictions imposed by parliamentary privilege, allowing them to fully investigate government actions and inactions.",
  "detailed_summary": "The bill affects the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 by adding a provision which allows Royal Commissions, with terms of reference that require examining government actions, to draw inferences or conclusions from proceedings in Parliament despite parliamentary privilege. From the explanatory memo: <blockquote>The exemption would allow exempted Royal Commissions to draw, or invite the drawing of, inferences or conclusions wholly or partly from anything forming part of proceedings in Parliament.</blockquote> This change is in response to Recommendation 7 of the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide interim report, which found that parliamentary privilege was hindering its ability to inquire into government actions necessary for its investigation.",

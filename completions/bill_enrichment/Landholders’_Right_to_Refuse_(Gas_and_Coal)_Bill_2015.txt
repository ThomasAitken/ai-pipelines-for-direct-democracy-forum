  "high_level_summary": "The Landholdersâ€™ Right to Refuse (Gas and Coal) Bill 2015 proposes to grant Australian landholders the right to refuse gas and coal mining activities on their land and bans hydraulic fracturing (fracking) for coal seam gas, shale gas, and tight gas by constitutional corporations.",
  "detailed_summary": "The bill affects the legal framework governing gas and coal mining in Australia by granting landholders the right to refuse such activities on their land. Specifically, it requires constitutional corporations to secure prior written authorization from landholders before commencing any exploration or production activities. It also makes it unlawful for these corporations to engage in hydraulic fracturing operations. <br><br>From the explanatory memo: <blockquote>The Bill provides that it is an offence for constitutional corporations to engage in gas or coal mining activities without the landholder's prior written authorization and bans hydraulic fracturing operations. Landholders can take civil action against corporations violating these provisions, and the bill outlines penalties and injunctions applicable under the Federal Court.</blockquote>",

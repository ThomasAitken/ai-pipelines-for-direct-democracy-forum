By mandating the reporting of suspicious transactions, it upholds ethical business practices and reduces the risk of money laundering within the gambling sector. This contributes to the overall integrity of the financial system and serves the public interest by protecting individuals from financial harm [Judgment]. Furthermore, ensuring that compensation is available to those harmed by illegally obtained funds aligns with principles of justice and fairness [Judgment].</p>",

These requirements might deter some businesses from entering the market or result in reduced services offered to consumers [Judgment]. Additionally, there is a concern that the bill may lead to over-reporting to AUSTRAC, bogging down the system with false positives and diverting resources from more significant threats [Judgment].</p>",

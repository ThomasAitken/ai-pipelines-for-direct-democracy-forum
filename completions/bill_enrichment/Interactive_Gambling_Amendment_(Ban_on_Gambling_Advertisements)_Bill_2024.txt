The advertising ban does not apply to excluded wagering and lottery services. The bill introduces new sections and amendments to existing sections in the Interactive Gambling Act 2001, defining and enforcing penalties for the advertisement of licensed interactive wagering services.

This aligns with the broader public health goal of reducing gambling-related harm and promoting social welfare.

Advertising is a critical component of business operations, and restricting it could lead to economic disadvantages for these companies and their employees. The limitations could be seen as disproportionate and may fail to adequately balance the interest of protecting public health with the rights of businesses to communicate about legal products [<a href=\"/about/argument-guidelines#Judgment\">Judgment</a>]. Additionally, there are concerns that such restrictions might drive gambling promotion underground or lead to unintended consequences, such as the rise of unregulated gambling activities.</p>",

  "high_level_summary": "The Broadcasting Services Amendment (Audio Description) Bill 2019 proposes to amend the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to mandate that broadcasters provide a minimum number of audio description hours per week, enhancing accessibility for individuals who are blind or have low vision.",
  "detailed_summary": "<p>The bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 by introducing a requirement for national broadcasters, commercial television broadcasting licensees, and subscription television licensees to provide a minimum number of hours of audio description per week. This is to be enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) through a new Part 9D - Division 3A.</p><p>From the explanatory memo: <blockquote>The Bill will draw on the existing legislative and regulatory framework as it applies to captioning and provide differently for audio description where appropriate. It introduces a phased approach to implementation, beginning with 14 hours per week in the first three years, increasing to 21 hours in the fourth year, and 28 hours in the fifth year. Exemptions can be granted by ACMA in cases of unjustifiable hardship.</blockquote></p><p>The bill also outlines the conditions under which exemptions can be granted and establishes compliance reporting and record-keeping requirements. It mandates ACMA to conduct reviews of the implementation and effectiveness of the audio description requirements.</p>",

By providing audio descriptions, the bill aligns with Australia's commitments under international human rights treaties, like the CRPD, enhancing social inclusion and cultural participation for people with disabilities [<a href=\"/about/argument-guidelines#Judgment\">Judgment</a>]. Moreover, the bill strengthens democratic engagement by enabling a broader section of the population to participate in cultural and informational media, promoting a more informed society.</p>",

The requirement for a minimum number of audio description hours may not be financially feasible for smaller broadcasters, potentially leading to increased prices for consumers or reduced service offerings [<a href=\"/about/argument-guidelines#Judgment\">Judgment</a>]. Additionally, while the intent is to promote equality, it might inadvertently create a one-size-fits-all mandate that does not account for the varying needs and capabilities of different broadcasters, which could stifle innovation and flexibility in how they provide accessible services.</p>",

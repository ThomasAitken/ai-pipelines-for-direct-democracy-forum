  "high_level_summary": "The bill proposes to establish 'Help to Buy', a shared equity program that assists low to middle-income earners in purchasing new or existing homes through an equity contribution from the Commonwealth.",
  "detailed_summary": "The Help to Buy Bill 2023, along with the Help to Buy (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2023, establishes a shared equity program to assist low to middle-income earners in purchasing homes. The program will be administered by Housing Australia and allows for an equity contribution from the Commonwealth of up to 30% of the purchase price for existing homes and up to 40% for new homes. The primary legislative framework for the program is laid out in the Help to Buy Bill, while the Consequential Provisions Bill amends various existing Commonwealth legislations to facilitate the program's operation. From the explanatory memo: <blockquote>The Bill and the Consequential Provisions Bill give effect to the Governmentâ€™s commitment to establish Help to Buy to assist Australians on low to middle incomes access home ownership.</blockquote>",

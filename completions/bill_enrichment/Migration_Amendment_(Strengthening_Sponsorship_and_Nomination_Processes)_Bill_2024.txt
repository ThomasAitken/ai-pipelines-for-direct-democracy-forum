  "high_level_summary": "The Migration Amendment (Strengthening Sponsorship and Nomination Processes) Bill 2024 aims to amend the Migration Act 1958 to implement new settings for skilled visas. The bill proposes the creation of a new Skills in Demand visa, replacing the Temporary Skill Shortage visa, with different streams based on income thresholds and skills demand.",
  "detailed_summary": "The bill affects the Migration Act 1958 by introducing new provisions for setting income thresholds and indexation for the proposed Skills in Demand visa, which includes three streams: Specialist Skills, Core Skills, and Essential Skills. It specifies that the Specialist Skills stream is for workers earning over $135,000 annually, while the Core Skills stream is for workers in shortage occupations earning over $73,150. The Essential Skills stream's income threshold can be set by regulations or specified by the Minister in writing. Additionally, the bill extends the validity period for labour market testing from 4 to 6 months and establishes a register of approved work sponsors to enhance transparency and oversight. From the explanatory memo: <blockquote>Proposed subsection 140GB(2A) sets income thresholds for different streams and allows the Minister to specify thresholds for the Essential Skills stream, ensuring flexibility and responsiveness to market needs.</blockquote>",

Additionally, the exclusion of trades from the Specialist Skills pathway might create disparities between blue-collar and white-collar jobs, which could undermine efforts to achieve equality in the labor force.</p>",

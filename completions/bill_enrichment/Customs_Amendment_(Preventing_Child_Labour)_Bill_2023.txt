  "high_level_summary": "The Customs Amendment (Preventing Child Labour) Bill 2023 seeks to amend the Customs Act 1901 to penalize or ban the importation of goods into Australia if they are suspected to involve child labour, in line with international child labour standards.",
  "detailed_summary": "The bill modifies the Customs Act 1901 to introduce civil penalties and import bans for goods linked to child labour. An importer may receive a notice if an authorised officer suspects their goods involve child labour. Notices require importers to provide information or take corrective action within three months. Failure to comply can result in penalties scaling up to a total ban after 48 months. The definition of child labour is consistent with the International Labour Organisation Convention No. 138, focusing on underage work that interferes with compulsory education. The bill is designed with phased penalties to allow businesses time to adjust, ensuring international trade standards are met without adverse economic impacts.",

By focusing on education, the bill aims to break cycles of poverty and improve long-term economic outcomes for children and their communities. Furthermore, it provides a structured approach for importers to amend their supply chains responsibly, thereby promoting ethical business practices without immediate economic fallout.</p>",

Although the bill allows for a transition period, the economic impact on families who rely on child labour for survival may be significant. Additionally, the administrative burden on importers to verify supply chains could increase operational costs, potentially leading to higher consumer prices [Judgment].</p>",

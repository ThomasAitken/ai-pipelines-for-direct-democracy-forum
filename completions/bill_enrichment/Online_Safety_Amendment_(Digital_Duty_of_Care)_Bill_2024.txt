By shifting the duty of care to the platforms, the bill supports the principle of non-discrimination, ensuring that vulnerable groups such as children and victims of gender-based violence are protected [<a href=\"/about/argument-guidelines#Judgment\">Judgment</a>]. Furthermore, it enhances democratic processes by requiring transparency and accountability, thus preventing manipulation of public opinion and electoral processes [<a href=\"/about/argument-guidelines#Judgment\">Judgment</a>].

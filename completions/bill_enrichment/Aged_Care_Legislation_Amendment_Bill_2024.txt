Schedule 2 amends the Aged Care Act and the Aged Care (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997 to allow for the use of refundable deposit balance information to verify income and asset details of care recipients, reducing the likelihood of financial inaccuracies. Schedule 3 clarifies the maximum accommodation payment for voluntary moves within services, encouraging improved accommodation stock.

The civil penalties for non-compliance with data requests could also be viewed as excessive, potentially deterring providers from participating in the aged care system. Furthermore, the increased oversight might infringe on the autonomy of care providers, restricting their ability to manage their operations independently.</p>",

  "high_level_summary": "The Housing Australia Future Fund Bill 2023 [No. 2] proposes to establish a $10 billion fund to support the creation of social and affordable housing, as well as address acute housing needs, including those of Indigenous communities, women, children, and veterans. The bill aims to deliver 30,000 social and affordable homes over five years.",
  "detailed_summary": "The bill establishes the Housing Australia Future Fund (HAFF), a Commonwealth investment fund, credited with $10 billion to be used for social and affordable housing projects across Australia. The HAFF is part of a broader strategy to improve housing supply and affordability, and it includes the creation of a National Housing Supply and Affordability Council to advise the government on housing policy. The HAFF will provide up to $500 million annually to support housing projects addressing acute needs. Key allocations over the first five years include: 20,000 social housing units, 10,000 affordable homes for frontline workers, $200 million for Indigenous communities, $100 million for crisis housing for women and children, and $30 million for veterans. From the explanatory memo: <blockquote>The HAFF would consist of the HAFF Special Account and the investments of the HAFF. It would be a dedicated investment vehicle to provide an additional funding source for social and affordable housing in Australia and to fund certain other acute housing needs.</blockquote>",

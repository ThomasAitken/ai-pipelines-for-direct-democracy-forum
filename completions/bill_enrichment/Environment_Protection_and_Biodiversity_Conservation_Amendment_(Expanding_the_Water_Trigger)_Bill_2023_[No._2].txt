  "high_level_summary": "The bill proposes to amend the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 to include all unconventional gas developments under the water trigger, requiring them to be assessed for their impact on water resources.",
  "detailed_summary": "The bill affects the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 by expanding the scope of the water trigger to include all forms of unconventional gas development, such as shale gas, in addition to coal seam gas development. It mandates that any action involving these types of developments must receive approval from the Minister for Environment if it is likely to have a significant impact on water resources. This change is intended to enhance the Commonwealth's oversight of the environmental impacts on water resources from unconventional gas developments and provide better protection for Australia's rivers, aquifers, and wetlands. From the explanatory memo: <blockquote>This Bill will simply expand the water trigger to require the Minister to assess the significant impacts on water resources of all unconventional gas developments, as has been recommended by both the Northern Territoryâ€™s Independent Scientific Inquiry into Hydraulic Fracturing of Onshore Unconventional Reservoirs in the Northern Territory conducted by Justice Pepper and the Senate Inquiry into Oil and gas exploration and production in the Beetaloo Basin.</blockquote>",

This is crucial for preserving natural ecosystems and maintaining clean water supplies for communities that depend on these resources [<a href=\"/about/argument-guidelines#Judgment\">Judgment</a>]. The expansion of the water trigger aligns with recommendations from scientific inquiries and the government's Nature Positive Plan, indicating a consensus on the need for such regulatory oversight. By protecting water resources, the bill supports equitable access to clean water, a fundamental right and necessity for all Australians.</p>",

This could lead to reduced competitiveness of the Australian energy sector on a global scale, and may negatively impact job creation and energy independence [<a href=\"/about/argument-guidelines#Judgment\">Judgment</a>]. Furthermore, the existing regulations already ensure that significant impacts on water resources are considered, making the expansion unnecessary and duplicative.</p>",

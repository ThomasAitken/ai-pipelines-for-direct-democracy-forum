  "high_level_summary": "The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Save the Koala) Bill 2021 proposes to impose a moratorium on the clearing of koala habitats to prevent their extinction, particularly in New South Wales by 2050.",
  "detailed_summary": "The bill amends the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) by introducing a new section 18B that prohibits actions likely to have a significant impact on koalas without approval. It also removes the exemption of Regional Forest Agreements from the EPBC Act's requirements where there is or may be a significant impact on koalas. Additionally, the bill prevents the Minister from approving actions involving the clearing of koala habitat (section 139) and defines terms such as 'koala habitat' and 'significant impact' under new sections 527F and 527G.",

The bill aligns with the principles of environmentalism by prioritizing the preservation of natural ecosystems and ensuring the survival of a species that is an integral part of Australia's ecological heritage. Furthermore, by safeguarding koala habitats, the bill supports non-discrimination principles by ensuring that the well-being of non-human species is considered in development actions, promoting ecological inclusivity [<a href=\"/about/argument-guidelines#Judgment\">Judgment</a>].</p>",

By restricting land clearing, it could hinder development projects that are crucial for economic growth and national prestige. While the protection of koalas is important, the economic implications of such stringent measures could lead to adverse effects on industries reliant on land development, potentially affecting jobs and national economic progress [<a href=\"/about/argument-guidelines#Judgment\">Judgment</a>].</p>",

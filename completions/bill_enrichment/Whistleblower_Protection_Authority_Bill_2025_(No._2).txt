While the intention is to protect whistleblowers, there is a risk of overreach, where the authority could interfere with private sector operations in ways that might harm property rights and business interests [<a href=\"/about/argument-guidelines#Judgment\">Judgment</a>]. Additionally, the functions of the authority could be integrated into existing bodies rather than creating a new entity, thus avoiding redundancy in the governmental framework.</p>",

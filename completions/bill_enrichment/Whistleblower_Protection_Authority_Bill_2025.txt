A Whistleblower Protection Authority can significantly enhance transparency and accountability within organizations by encouraging disclosures of misconduct without fear of retribution. This can lead to a more honest and transparent government and corporate environment, which is foundational to a healthy democracy. Furthermore, protecting whistleblowers upholds the principle of non-discrimination by ensuring that all individuals, regardless of their role or status, have the right to report misconduct without facing adverse consequences [<a href=\"/about/argument-guidelines#Judgment\">Judgment</a>].</p>",

There is a risk that the Authority might overlap with current anti-corruption bodies, leading to duplication of efforts and potential jurisdictional conflicts. Additionally, the lack of financial impact stated might suggest that the Authority could be underfunded, which would undermine its effectiveness in delivering on its promises [<a href=\"/about/argument-guidelines#Judgment\">Judgment</a>]. Moreover, businesses may fear that an empowered whistleblower authority could lead to an increase in frivolous claims, potentially causing harm to reputations and financial loss without due cause.</p>",

  "high_level_summary": "The Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Quality and Integrity) Bill 2024 aims to enhance the quality, integrity, and sustainable growth of Australia's international education sector by amending the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000.",
  "detailed_summary": "The bill amends the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 to address issues such as collusive practices between education providers and agents, and the exploitation of students. It requires providers to disclose education agent commissions, enables automatic cancellation of provider registrations under specific conditions, and allows the Minister for Education to set enrolment limits for overseas students. Moreover, the bill introduces new requirements for providers to deliver courses to domestic students before applying to offer courses to overseas students. It also empowers the Minister to suspend applications for provider registration or course additions to manage sector growth and integrity. From the explanatory memo: <blockquote>The bill specifically addresses the findings of the Nixon Review into the exploitation of Australia's visa system and aligns with the Government's Migration Strategy.</blockquote>",

The provisions for automatic suspension and cancellation of courses that do not meet quality standards further protect students' rights to education. These measures collectively contribute to a more equitable and non-discriminatory education landscape.</p>",

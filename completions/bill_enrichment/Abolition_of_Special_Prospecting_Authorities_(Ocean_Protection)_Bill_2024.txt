  "high_level_summary": "The bill proposes to abolish Special Prospecting Authorities (SPAs) to prevent seismic testing in ocean habitats, thereby protecting marine life. It aims to stop the granting, consideration, and renewal of SPAs after December 31, 2024.",
  "detailed_summary": "The bill affects the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 by amending it to prohibit the Titles Administrator from considering, granting, or renewing any petroleum Special Prospecting Authorities after December 31, 2024. <blockquote>From the explanatory memo: The purpose of this Bill is to stop seismic testing pursuant to SPAs and protect marine life.</blockquote> Seismic testing, allowed under SPAs, has been shown to have detrimental impacts on marine ecosystems, affecting breeding and feeding grounds of sea creatures. The bill seeks to eliminate these activities in order to safeguard oceanic biodiversity. The bill has no financial impact.",

By eliminating SPAs, the bill ensures that these potentially harmful activities are curtailed, promoting biodiversity and protecting endangered species. Furthermore, the bill embodies principles of non-discrimination by safeguarding all marine life equally, irrespective of economic interests in oil and gas exploration.</p>",

Additionally, the bill might affect Australia's competitive edge in the global energy sector, thereby reducing its national prestige and economic influence.</p>",

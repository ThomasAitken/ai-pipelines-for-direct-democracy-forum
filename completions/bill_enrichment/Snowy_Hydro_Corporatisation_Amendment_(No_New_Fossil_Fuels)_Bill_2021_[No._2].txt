  "detailed_summary": "The bill amends the Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Act 1997 to introduce a prohibition on Snowy Hydro and its group companies from being involved in the development, construction, acquisition, or operation of new fossil fuel-based electricity generation capacity. This prohibition applies only to 'new' capacity, excluding projects from assets owned, controlled, or operated before the bill's commencement, or those under binding contracts entered into before the commencement. The bill also includes a new objects clause to contextualize these prohibitions within the goal of reducing Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. From the explanatory memo: <blockquote>The Bill would also insert a new objects clause, a new paragraph in the simplified outline, and a number of new definitions in order to facilitate these changes.</blockquote>",

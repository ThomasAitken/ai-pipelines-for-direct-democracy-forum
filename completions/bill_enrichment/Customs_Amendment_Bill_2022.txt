  "high_level_summary": "The bill proposes to amend the Customs Act 1901 by removing a duplicate definition of 'Export entry advice'. This change is intended to streamline and improve the legislative clarity of the Customs Act.",
  "detailed_summary": "The bill affects the Customs Act 1901 by repealing the definition of 'Export entry advice' in subsection 4(1). The Customs Act currently contains two definitions of 'Export entry advice', one of which is outdated and redundant. The amendment will remove the older, unnecessary definition to ensure the Act's language is consistent and up-to-date. From the explanatory memo: <blockquote>The definition of Export entry advice was contained in the Act first. The definition of export entry advice was inserted into the Act by item 52 of Schedule 3 to the Customs Legislation Amendment and Repeal (International Trade Modernisation) Act 2001. Item 62 of Schedule 3 to that Act remade section 114C, which deals with export entry advice, and included language of Customs 'giving' an export entry advice, consistently with the definition of export entry advice. The definition of Export entry advice would be repealed by item 1 of Schedule 1 to the Bill, as the definition is out of date and redundant.</blockquote>",

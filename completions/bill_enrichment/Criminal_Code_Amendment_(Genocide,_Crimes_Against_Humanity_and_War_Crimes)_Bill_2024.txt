  "high_level_summary": "The bill proposes to amend the Criminal Code Act 1995 to remove the requirement for the Attorney-General's consent to prosecute cases of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes, thus enhancing Australia's compliance with international human rights obligations.",
  "detailed_summary": "The bill affects the Criminal Code Act 1995 by repealing sections 268.121 and 268.122, which currently require the Attorney-General's written consent to commence proceedings related to genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. This amendment aims to eliminate the potential conflict of interest and to ensure that these proceedings can be initiated without government bias. <br><br>From the explanatory memo: <blockquote>The practical impact of this Bill is that the consent of the Attorney-General will not be required for proceedings relating to genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and crimes against the administration of the justice of the International Criminal Court commenced after the commencement of the Act. It further removes the restrictions on review of decisions of the Attorney-General to give or refuse consent to institute proceedings for such offences made prior to the commencement of the Act.</blockquote>",

By removing the Attorney-General's fiat, it ensures unbiased and fair access to justice for victims and supports the principles of equality before the law and non-discrimination as outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This change promotes democracy by ensuring that prosecutions for these serious crimes are not hindered by political considerations, thereby strengthening the rule of law and reinforcing Australia's commitment to human rights.</p>",
  "argument_against": "<i>Normative Bases</i><ol><li><a href=\"/about/normative-bases#SameAsOpponent\">Same as Opponent</a></li></ol><p>One might argue against the bill by suggesting that removing the Attorney-General's oversight could lead to politically motivated or frivolous prosecutions, which could burden the legal system and divert resources from other important areas. The current requirement for the Attorney-General's consent may serve as a necessary check to ensure that only cases with sufficient merit proceed. Without this check, there could be increased risks of abuse of the judicial process [Judgment].</p>",

  "high_level_summary": "The bill proposes to end the live export of sheep by sea from Australia by legislating a final date for the phase-out, set for 1 May 2026.",
  "detailed_summary": "The bill amends the Export Control Act 2020 to include a prohibition on the export of livestock sheep by sea starting from 1 May 2026. Specifically, it inserts a new section, 23A, into the Act, marking sheep as permanently prohibited goods for export by sea. This applies to sheep of all ages, as clarified by an amendment to section 12 of the Act. Division 4 of Part 1 of Chapter 2 of the Export Control Act 2020 outlines the offences and civil penalties for breaches of this new prohibition.",

The bill aligns with the principle of non-discrimination by ensuring that sheep, regardless of age, are protected under the new regulation, promoting humane treatment for all animals. Furthermore, by setting a definitive end date, the bill provides certainty and allows farmers and businesses time to adjust to the changes, potentially fostering more sustainable and ethical farming practices [<a href=\"/about/argument-guidelines#Judgment\">Judgment</a>].</p>",

From a propertarian perspective, the bill could infringe on the rights of farmers to manage and sell their livestock as they see fit. Furthermore, the utilitarian argument suggests that the economic benefits of live sheep export, which supports livelihoods and contributes to Australia's economy, might outweigh the potential welfare gains. The transition may lead to economic hardship for those involved in the industry if alternative markets or compensation measures are not adequately established [<a href=\"/about/argument-guidelines#Judgment\">Judgment</a>].</p>",

It is part of a broader initiative to address housing needs and affordability challenges in Australia.",
  "detailed_summary": "The National Housing Supply and Affordability Council Bill 2023 establishes the Council as an independent statutory advisory body. The Council's role includes advising the Government on improving housing supply and affordability, conducting research, and building an evidence base to support housing policy development. The Council will operate under the legislative framework provided by the Housing Council Bill. Financially, the establishment of the Council is estimated to have a negative impact of $15.2 million over four years starting in 2022-23 and $4.4 million annually thereafter. The bill aims to engage human rights positively by supporting the right to adequate housing and social services. From the explanatory memo: <blockquote>The measure was announced in the 2022-23 October Budget as part of the Safer and More Affordable Housing measure to give effect to the Government's 2022 election commitment to establish the Council to support the Government to develop housing supply and affordability policy through research and advice.</blockquote>",

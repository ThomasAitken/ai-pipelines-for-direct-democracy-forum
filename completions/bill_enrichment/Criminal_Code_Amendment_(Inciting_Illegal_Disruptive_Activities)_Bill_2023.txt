  "detailed_summary": "The bill affects the Criminal Code Act 1995 by adding new offences under Subdivision K in Division 474. These offences include using a carriage service to incite trespass (punishable by up to 12 months imprisonment), property damage or theft (punishable by up to 5 years imprisonment), and unlawful obstruction of traffic (punishable by up to 12 months imprisonment) in major business areas. It mirrors provisions from the Criminal Code Amendment (Agricultural Protection) Bill 2019 and includes exemptions for journalists and whistleblowers. From the explanatory memo: <blockquote>The bill aims to address the misuse of carriage services to plan and incite activities causing significant economic disruption, ensuring that organisers face due punishment while balancing the right to protest with public safety and property rights.</blockquote>",

Moreover, the presumption that a carriage service is used for incitement could lead to overreach and unjust prosecutions, thus stifling intellectual discourse and political engagement.</p>",

The concentration of media ownership, particularly by the Murdoch empire, poses a threat to fair and unbiased journalism, which is crucial for an informed public and a functioning democracy. By investigating media practices and proposing regulations, the bill seeks to safeguard journalistic integrity and prevent the dissemination of misinformation [<a href=\"/about/argument-guidelines#Judgment\">Judgment</a>]. Additionally, the inquiry can address discriminatory media practices, ensuring fair representation of marginalized communities.</p>",

Excessive government scrutiny and regulation could lead to a chilling effect on free speech and press freedom. There is a risk that the inquiry could be perceived as a politically motivated attack on specific media outlets, which could undermine its legitimacy and effectiveness [<a href=\"/about/argument-guidelines#Judgment\">Judgment</a>]. Furthermore, the resources required to conduct such an extensive inquiry could be better allocated to other pressing issues.</p>",

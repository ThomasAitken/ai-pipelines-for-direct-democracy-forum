  "high_level_summary": "The bill proposes to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to increase the number of senators representing the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory to provide for fairer representation.",
  "detailed_summary": "The bill affects the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 by increasing the number of senators for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory to half the number of senators for a State, rounded up or down to the nearest whole number, rounding up if the number ends in .5. This results in three senators from each of the territories being elected at each federal election, with terms of six years. The changes are intended to improve democratic representation for the territories, reflecting their residents' views more accurately.",

Increasing the number of senators allows these territories to have a stronger voice in federal matters, ensuring that the diverse views and interests of their populations are more effectively represented. This change addresses historical imbalances in representation that have disadvantaged the territories compared to the states.</p>",
  "argument_against": "<i>Normative Bases</i><ol><li><a href=\"/about/normative-bases#SameAsOpponent\">Same as Opponent</a></li></ol><p>The bill should be opposed because it disrupts the original design of the Senate as a body representing the states equally, potentially leading to a dilution of the principle that smaller states should have equal representation to larger ones. Additionally, increasing the number of senators for territories could set a precedent for future modifications that might further alter the balance of power in the Senate, potentially leading to calls for similar increases in other regions [<a href=\"/about/argument-guidelines#Judgment\">Judgment</a>].</p>",

  "high_level_summary": "The bill proposes to enhance transparency and integrity in government decision-making by imposing stricter regulations on lobbying activities. It aims to extend the current Register of Lobbyists to include more comprehensive information about lobbyists and their activities, and to enforce standards that prevent conflicts of interest and promote accountability.",
  "detailed_summary": "The Lobbying (Improving Government Honesty and Trust) Bill 2024 introduces measures to improve transparency and accountability in lobbying activities. It extends the Register of Lobbyists to include not only professional lobbyists acting on behalf of third-party clients but also in-house lobbyists representing businesses and industry bodies. The bill mandates that lobbyists prepare and submit quarterly returns detailing their meetings with government officials, including the topics discussed and the attendees. It prohibits unregistered lobbying and strengthens the post-employment cooling-off period for former ministers and senior officials to three years. Additionally, it requires the publication of ministerial diaries to disclose meetings with stakeholders and lobbyists. The bill empowers the National Anti-Corruption Commission to investigate breaches and imposes penalties such as fines and suspension of registration for non-compliance. From the explanatory memo: <blockquote>This Bill introduces several measures to enhance the integrity of Government decision-making by extending the Register of Lobbyists to include registered professional lobbyists acting on behalf of third parties, services firms, and lobbyists acting on behalf of businesses and industry bodies ('in house lobbyists').</blockquote>",

By requiring comprehensive disclosures of lobbying activities, it helps to ensure that decisions are made in the public interest and not unduly influenced by private interests. The publication of ministerial diaries and enforcement of a longer cooling-off period for former government officials helps to mitigate conflicts of interest, thereby strengthening public trust in government institutions. These measures collectively aim to address the public's concerns about the integrity of the political system and reduce the perception of corruption [Judgment].</p>",

The stringent registration and reporting requirements may deter individuals and organizations from engaging in legitimate advocacy and political discourse. Additionally, the bill's measures might be seen as an overreach of government authority, impacting the rights of private entities to conduct business and interact with government representatives. This could lead to a chilling effect on lobbying activities, which are a legitimate part of the democratic process [Judgment].</p>",

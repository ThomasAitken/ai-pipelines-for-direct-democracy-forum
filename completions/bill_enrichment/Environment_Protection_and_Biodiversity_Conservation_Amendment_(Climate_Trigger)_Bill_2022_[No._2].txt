  "high_level_summary": "The bill proposes to amend the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 to introduce a 'climate trigger' for assessing emissions-intensive activities. This aims to ensure that such activities are scrutinized for their environmental impact in line with Australia's climate obligations.",
  "detailed_summary": "The bill affects the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 by establishing a new class of controlled actions related to greenhouse gas emissions. It introduces two thresholds: a 'Significant Impact on Emissions' for projects emitting between 25,000 to 100,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent annually, which requires detailed assessment by the Minister, and a 'Prohibited Impact on Emissions' for projects exceeding 100,000 tonnes, which are to be automatically rejected. Additionally, the bill mandates the Climate Change Authority to develop and annually assess a national carbon budget to 2050, against which projects must be evaluated. It prohibits the Minister from using alternative approval processes for actions with significant emissions impacts, ensuring they are assessed under specified parts of the EPBC Act.",

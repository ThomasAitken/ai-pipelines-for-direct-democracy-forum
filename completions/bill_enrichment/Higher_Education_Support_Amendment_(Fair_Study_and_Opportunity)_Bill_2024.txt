  "detailed_summary": "The Higher Education Support Amendment (Fair Study and Opportunity) Bill 2024 amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003 by moving subjects listed under 'Society and Culture' from table item 1 to table item 2 in 'Maximum student contribution amounts for a place'. This change will lower the maximum fee charged to students from $15,142 to $4,124 per unit. The amendments apply to units of study with a census date on or after 1 January 2025. From the explanatory memo: <blockquote>The Job-ready Graduates policy of the Morrisson Government significantly increased the student contribution for Arts degrees as part of an initiative to encourage STEM course enrolment. However, this measure had minimal effect, and the bill aims to rectify this by making Arts education more affordable.</blockquote>",

Reducing the cost of 'Society and Culture' subjects aligns with the principle of egalitarianism by ensuring that all students, regardless of financial background, have the opportunity to pursue their interests and talents in these fields. Moreover, a well-rounded education system that includes affordable Arts education is vital for fostering informed and engaged citizens, which strengthens democratic processes [<a href=\"/about/argument-guidelines#Judgment\">Judgment</a>].</p>",

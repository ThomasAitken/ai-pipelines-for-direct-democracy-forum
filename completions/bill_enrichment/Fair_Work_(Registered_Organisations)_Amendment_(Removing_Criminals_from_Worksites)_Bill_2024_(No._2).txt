This supports the principle of non-discrimination by promoting fair treatment and accountability for all members. By enforcing legal standards and disqualifying those with criminal histories, the bill strengthens democratic governance within these organisations [<a href=\"/about/argument-guidelines#Judgment\">Judgment</a>]. Furthermore, maintaining the integrity of registered organisations protects the interests of their members and upholds the rule of law.</p>",

The disqualification of individuals based on past offenses may not consider their rehabilitation or current capabilities, potentially violating egalitarian principles. Additionally, the bill's broad criteria for disqualification might undermine the autonomy of organisations to elect leaders they trust, potentially infringing on their democratic rights [<a href=\"/about/argument-guidelines#Judgment\">Judgment</a>].</p>",

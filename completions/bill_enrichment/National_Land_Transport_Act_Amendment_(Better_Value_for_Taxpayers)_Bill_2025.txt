  "detailed_summary": "The bill affects the National Land Transport Act by adding measures that require the Federal Government to prepare and publish a long-term national land transport plan, publish business cases for federally funded projects above a certain threshold, and conduct and publish post-completion reviews for such projects. From the explanatory memo: <blockquote>The bill is a response to reviews that identified poor returns on investment and significant issues in the project selection process. It aims to restore confidence in land transport investment decisions by introducing transparency and accountability measures.</blockquote> Specific amendments include the insertion of new objectives in Section 3 to provide transparency in Commonwealth funding decisions, the addition of several definitions in Section 4 to facilitate these measures, and the introduction of new Sections 15, 15A, 35A, 94A, 94B, and 95A that outline the requirements for planning, business case publication, and post-completion reviews.",

By requiring the publication of business cases and post-completion reviews, the bill fosters informed public discourse and oversight, aligning with democratic principles. These measures also incentivize rigorous project planning and execution, potentially reducing cost overruns and increasing public trust in infrastructure investments.</p>",
  "argument_against": "<i>Normative Bases</i><ol><li><a href=\"/about/normative-bases#Propertarianism\">Propertarianism</a></li></ol><p>The bill should be opposed because it may impose additional bureaucratic burdens on infrastructure projects, potentially delaying their approval and implementation. The requirement for detailed business case publications and post-completion reviews could lead to increased administrative costs and slow down the pace of essential infrastructure development. This could ultimately impede timely economic growth and result in inefficiencies in addressing urgent transport infrastructure needs [Judgment].</p>",

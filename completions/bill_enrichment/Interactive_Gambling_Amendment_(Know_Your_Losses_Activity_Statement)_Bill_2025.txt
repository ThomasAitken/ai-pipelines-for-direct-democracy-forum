  "high_level_summary": "The bill proposes to amend the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 to require that licensed interactive wagering services display real-time activity statements showing users' net positions of wins and losses during wagering on online applications and websites.",
  "detailed_summary": "The Interactive Gambling Amendment (Know Your Losses Activity Statement) Bill 2025 amends the Interactive Gambling Act 2001. It mandates that all licensed interactive wagering services must prominently display real-time activity statement information to users during their use of the service. This information includes the user's total net losses and wins for the calendar month, year, and since the provision's commencement. The bill creates a criminal offence and a civil penalty if a service provider fails to display this information, with penalties applicable for each day of non-compliance. The bill provides a six-month implementation period post-Royal Assent for service providers to comply with the new requirements. From the explanatory memo: <blockquote>The bill aims to lessen problematic online gambling among Australians by ensuring users are continually aware of their gambling activity, thus supporting informed decision-making and reducing gambling-related harms.</blockquote>",
  "argument_for": "<i>Normative Bases</i><ol><li><a href=\"/about/normative-bases#ConsumerProtection\">Consumer Protection</a></li><li><a href=\"/about/normative-bases#PublicHealth\">Public Health</a></li></ol><p>The bill should be supported because it aims to reduce gambling-related harm by ensuring gamblers are continuously informed about their financial activities, thereby promoting responsible gambling behaviors. By making real-time activity statements readily accessible, users can make more informed decisions about their gambling habits. This transparency aligns with consumer protection principles, providing individuals with the necessary information to safeguard their financial and mental well-being [<a href=\"/about/argument-guidelines#Judgment\">Judgment</a>]. Additionally, by reducing problem gambling, the bill contributes to improved public health outcomes, mitigating issues such as financial hardship, mental health problems, and family disruption, which are often associated with gambling addiction.</p>",

These costs might be passed on to consumers, ultimately reducing market competition and consumer choice. While the bill aims to protect gamblers, it might infringe on individual autonomy by presupposing that consumers cannot make informed decisions about their activities without constant oversight [<a href=\"/about/argument-guidelines#Judgment\">Judgment</a>]. Furthermore, the compliance costs associated with displaying real-time information could particularly affect smaller operators, potentially reducing their ability to compete with larger entities in the market.</p>",

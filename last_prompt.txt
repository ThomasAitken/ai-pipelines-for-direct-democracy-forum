Your task is to fill out a number of fields for a user-curated forum page relating to a bill before the Australian parliament. As I will explain below, some of these fields are argument fields, i.e. an "Argument For" and an "Argument Against" the bill. So let me first give you some information on the guidelines for the argument fields, as this will come in handy for your task:


#### Argument Guidelines ####

* How to Formulate a Political Argument *

Steps:
1. Enumerate your Normative Bases: Clearly state the fundamental principles or values that underpin your argument.
2. Clarify any further high-level assumptions: Specify any additional overarching assumptions that are essential to your reasoning.
3. Define any uncommon terms as necessary: Ensure that specialized or uncommon terms are clearly defined to avoid misunderstandings.
4. Present your argument in simple and precise language: Use clear and concise language. Claims with empirical content should be supported by footnotes linking to reliable sources or annotated as a "Judgment."


* Worked Examples *
The following is an example of an argument for the proposition that the government should grant funding to the Direct Democracy Forum. The argument is structured according to the guidelines above.
```

As long as it is able to attract and keep a strong pool of engaged users, this forum should be able to provide a unique service in producing up-to-date information and analysis on what is actually going on in parliament. The feature of displaying links to other media on each forum should also allow this site to serve as a news distributor and aggregator, thus likely strengthening the broader ecosystem of political discourse. In general, encouraging citizens to engage with politics in terms of concrete policy issues should promote a more intelligent and civil political culture [<a href="/about/argument-guidelines#Judgment">Judgment</a>].</p><p>Among many other secondary benefits we might imagine, one is that this site could become a powerful gauge of public opinion that goes beyond the usual vague polling questions to actually build a map of what people think on a range of concrete policy issues.</p><ol class="footnote-section footnotes" data-footnote-section="" role="doc-endnotes"><li class="footnote-item" data-footnote-item="" data-footnote-index="1" data-footnote-id="aq1upuv6w2f" role="doc-endnote" id="fnaq1upuv6w2f"><span class="footnote-back-link" data-footnote-back-link="" data-footnote-id="aq1upuv6w2f"><sup><strong><a href="#fnrefaq1upuv6w2f">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class="footnote-content" data-footnote-content=""><p>My estimate based on an assumption that I leave my day job and hire a small team.

```

The following is an example of an argument against the proposition that the government should grant funding to the Direct Democracy Forum. The argument is structured according to the guidelines above.
```
<i>Normative Bases</i><ol><li><a href="/about/normative-bases#SameAsOpponent">Same as Opponent</a></li></ol><p>Let's grant that the Direct Democracy Forum is a good idea. Even if so, the forum is better off getting grassroots funding from its users. The forum does not <i>need</i> government funding.

```

* What is a Judgment? *
When composing an argument, it is sometimes necessary to fall back on claims or contentions that loosely fall under the rubric of "Common Sense". These are not assumptions, derivations or direct empirical claims, but simply plausible judgments. Think the sort of assertion you would usually cloak in language like "I would claim" or "It is plausible to believe that" - something that rings true to you but which you would be hard-pressed to back up with a specific link or citation. As you can see in the Worked Example arguments above, in such cases you should avoid the usual hedging phrases and just make your assertion, plus an extra appendage like so: "[Judgment]". If you do not do this, then an admin will probably come by later and add a "Citation Needed" footnote to this same sentence, which will look worse!

It is also worth considering that you may not need to use a Judgment at all. The more judgments you make, the weaker your argument will be, relative to one that relies on more verifiable claims. So if you can substitute a judgment for a more directly verifiable claim, it is usually a good idea to do so.




#### Normative Bases Digest ####

* What is a "Normative Basis"? *
A normative basis serves as an ethical or legal cornerstone for political arguments. The set of bases that have been curated is designed to achieve comprehensive coverage of possible political arguments with minimal conceptual overlap.

* The Set of Normative Bases: *
    Meta:
        - Same as Opponent: Utilizing the same values as the opposing argument to challenge its reasoning or evidence.
        - Legal Principle: Basing arguments on legal foundations, such as constitutional provisions or international laws.

    Ethical Foundations:
        - Utilitarian Ground Truth: Focusing on actions that maximize overall well-being or minimize harm. (Only to be used in clear-cut cases.)
        - Egalitarianism: Advocating for equality in critical societal aspects like income, wealth, and access to services.
        - Propertarianism: Emphasizing the protection of existing property rights and private wealth.
        - Non-Discrimination: Opposing unequal treatment based on characteristics such as race, gender, or disability.
        - Pro-Democracy: Promoting active civic engagement and democratic governance.
        - Hobbesianism: Highlighting the necessity of authority and power for societal stability.
        - Environmentalism: Prioritizing the preservation and health of natural ecosystems.
        - National Prestige/Patriotism: Valuing the nation's global standing and influence.
        - Virtue of Gallantry/Machismo: Upholding values like honor, courage, and physical prowess.
        - Intellectualism: Esteeming knowledge, scholarship, and educational pursuits.
        - Aestheticism: Valuing the creation and appreciation of beauty, art, and cultural wealth.





### Instructions ###
With the above guidelines in mind, I can now give the instructions for how to fill out the fields of the forum page. Please follow these precisely.


You will need to fill out the following fields:

* Field 1: the High-level Summary of the Bill *
A statement, in simple language, of the purpose of the bill and what it proposes to change. Make it clear and concise - ideally 1-2 sentences.

If there is any relevant context or background, include it in the optional second paragraph.


* Field 2: the Detailed Summary of the Bill *
Whereas the high-level summary describes the idea of the bill without necessarily referring to specific legislation, this section should briefly describe which legislation is affected and how. There is currently a word limit of 300 words.

If there is a good bill digest or explanatory memo associated with the bill, you may be able to take guidance from it. If copying passages from these sources verbatim, please make sure to attribute and represent them as quotes, e.g. `From the explanatory memo: <blockquote>...</blockquote>`.


* Field 3: the Argument For the Bill *
This field should follow the argument guidelines that you read earlier. It must begin by enumerating appropriate Normative Bases (with hyperlinks) under an italicised heading of this name. This section can be brief if there is not much to say, or longer if there are many reasons to support the bill.


* Field 4: the Argument Against the Bill *
This field should follow the argument guidelines that you read earlier. It must begin by enumerating appropriate Normative Bases (with hyperlinks) under an italicised heading of this name. This section can be brief if there is not much to say, or longer if there are many reasons to oppose the bill.

Remember that "high_level_summary", "detailed_summary", "argument_for", and "argument_against" should be in HTML, using the same set of tags you have seen in the earlier Worked Example (plus `blockquote` for quotes). Recall that `<ul><li>` will work for bulleted lists and `<ol><li>` for numbered lists, <b> for bold and <u> for underlined. Footnotes should follow the same HTML formatting you saw earlier.

Thank you in advance.




### Information about the Bill ###
Finally, here is some context about the bill itself. The bill is titled "Health Legislation Amendment (Improved Medicare Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2024". The below is a dump of one or more PDFs that explains more about the bill. You will need to use this information to fill out the fields:

 
 
 
 
 
 
2022-2023-2024 
 
 
 
THE PARLIAMENT OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA 
 
 
 
 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (IMPROVED MEDICARE 
INTEGRITY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2024 
 
 
 
 
 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Hon Mark 
Butler MP)  
 
  
 
 
1 
HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (IMPROVED MEDICARE INTEGRITY 
AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2024 
 
OUTLINE 
 
The Health Legislation Amendment (Improved Medicare Integrity and Other 
Measures) Bill 2024 (the Bill) amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 (the Health 
Insurance Act), the National Health Act 1953 (the National Health Act), the Human 
Services (Medicare) Act 1973 (the Human Services Medicare Act), the Dental 
Benefits Act 2008 (the Dental Benefits Act), the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 
(the Therapeutic Goods Act), and the Public Health (Tobacco and Other Products) 
Act 2023 (the Tobacco Act) to implement a number of important public health 
measures. These measures are principally intended to protect the integrity of 
Medicare, enhance the regulation of goods under the Therapeutic Goods Act and 
make minor amendments to the Tobacco Act. 
 
A number of the amendments in the Bill form part of the response to the 
recommendations of the independent Review of Medicare Integrity and Compliance 
undertaken by Dr Pradeep Philip (Philip Review). The Philip Review identified a 
range of issues that affect the effective administration of health benefits schemes – in 
particular, the power to detect, respond to, investigate, disclose and deter misconduct, 
fraud and non-compliance. The amendments are necessary to protect the integrity of, 
and support the ongoing sustainability of, Australia’s health benefits schemes – the 
Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS), the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), and 
the Child Dental Benefits Schedule (CDBS). The Bill addresses a range of issues that 
are currently inhibiting the ability of the Department of Health and Aged Care 
(the Department) to conduct efficient, timely, and effective compliance activities. 
 
Measures relating to Medicare integrity 
 
The amendments relating to Medicare integrity are principally intended to: 
 
• improve payment integrity and reduce the number of incorrectly and 
fraudulently made claims by changing the timeframe for making Medicare 
claims for bulk-billed services from 2 years to 1 year; 
 
• update and broaden investigative powers to ensure they can be used 
consistently, effectively, and appropriately across health benefits schemes and 
in relation to a broader number of offences; and 
 
• improve pharmacy approval processes by making the processes simpler and 
more efficient. 
 
Australia has a world class health system that offers affordable, high-quality and 
accessible health care to all Australians. This is due in large part to the various health 
benefits schemes – including Medicare and its programs – that help Australians pay 
for the health care and medicines that they need. 
 
2 
In 2023-24, payments for personal benefits including medical services, 
pharmaceutical services and private health insurance rebates totalled at least $65.1 
billion – being approximately 63% of the total funding paid by the Department.1 
 
Legitimate public policy considerations require that the integrity of an investment on 
this scale is appropriately protected. This is because public resources are limited; any 
loss due to incorrect payments or fraud results in a reduced ability of others to access 
health services. 
 
It is essential that there are robust structures in place to identify and address incorrect 
payments and non-compliance. Such structures ensure that public resources are 
directed to necessary health services, and to ensure that health benefits schemes are – 
and continue to be – sustainable. 
 
While the Philip Review found that most health professionals are well meaning and 
protective of the health system, it also noted that changes are needed to improve the 
compliance system underpinning Medicare to ensure it remains rigorous and effective. 
 
The Bill makes several amendments in response to recommendations from the Philip 
Review to protect the integrity of health schemes and ensure robust systems are in 
place to prevent, identify, and respond to instances of non-compliance and fraud. 
 
These improvements will assist to ensure public resources are directed to necessary 
health services and that Australia’s healthcare systems remain sustainable and cost-
effective. 
 
The Philip Review 
 
The Philip Review focussed on the Medicare payment system and specifically on the 
integrity of claims for payment made by health practitioners. The review made a 
range of recommendations about how integrity could be strengthened, and how 
compliance processes could be streamlined and improved. Following these 
recommendations, the Bill seeks to amend health portfolio legislation to streamline, 
strengthen, and increase the efficacy of processes for addressing non-compliance and 
fraud involving health benefits schemes. 
 
The Philip Review referred to the need for integrity activities to identify and respond 
to any actors in the system who are unintentionally or dishonestly obtaining an 
incorrect payment. The Philip Review also referred to the need to ensure patient 
safety in all aspects of health services. 
 
The Philip Review noted that the systems underpinning health benefit schemes require 
changes to ensure that they remain rigorous and effective. 
 
While the review highlighted issues in relation to Medicare, the Department considers 
these issues are also relevant in relation to other health benefits schemes such as the 
Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. 
                                                 
1 Australian Public Service Commission, Capability Review Department of Health and Aged Care, p7. 
 
3 
 
The measures in the Bill are expected to increase the overall effectiveness and 
efficiency of compliance activities. The impact of these integrity measures is that 
patients and practitioners can expect to benefit from better protected health benefits 
schemes that will provide more secure access to safe, quality healthcare services. 
 
Timeframes for making Medicare claims 
 
The Bill changes the timeframe (from 2 years to 1 year) during which claims relating 
to bulk-billed Medicare and dental services may be made. 
  
This will improve payment integrity and reduce the number of incorrect and 
fraudulently made claims. The Minister (for Medicare claims) and the Chief 
Executive Medicare (for dental claims) will continue to have discretion to allow 
claims to be made after 1 year. This is likely to have minimal impact on patients and 
practitioners as most claims are already made within 1 year. 
  
Investigative powers 
 
The investigative powers in Part IID of the Human Services Medicare Act are 
fragmented and apply inconsistently due to the definition of ‘relevant offence’ in 
section 3A of that Act. 
 
The result is that authorised officers undertaking investigations do not have access to 
the full suite of powers for numerous offences. This is particularly problematic for the 
investigation of offences under the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Criminal Code) and the 
offences relating to PBS fraud in the National Health Act. In more serious cases, 
offences under the Criminal Code may be more appropriate given the higher 
maximum penalties available. 
 
There are also time restrictions on the ability to search with consent and on the 
retention of important evidence, which may result in difficulties undertaking 
prosecutions. Overall, the current powers are so narrow that they impede the proper 
exercise of powers to detect, investigate and refer potential fraud matters. 
 
The Bill amends the definition of ‘relevant offence’ in the Human Services Medicare 
Act to enable a single, consistent suite of investigative powers in relation to Medicare 
fraud offences. The amended definition incorporates a greater number of criminal 
offences – including additional offences in the Criminal Code such as money 
laundering, forgery and identity fraud offences, all of which are relevant to Medicare 
fraud. 
 
The changes will improve the use of the investigative powers, addressing gaps and 
inconsistencies in the current application of the provisions. The result will be greater 
scope to respond to potential non-compliance and fraud, enabling the investigation of 
a much broader range of conduct and, ultimately, improve abilities to successfully 
respond to potential misconduct. 
 
4 
Pharmacy approval processes 
 
The National Health Act provides that the Secretary of the Department may, upon 
application by a pharmacist, approve that pharmacist to supply pharmaceutical 
benefits from particular premises. 
 
Applications to establish a new pharmacy or relocate an existing pharmacy approved 
to supply pharmaceutical benefits must first be assessed against the National Health 
(Australian Community Pharmacy Authority Rules) Determination 2018 (PB 46 of 
2018) (the Location Rules) determined by the Minister for Health and Aged Care (the 
Minister) before the Secretary can consider granting approval to the pharmacist. 
Where an application does not meet the requirements of the Location Rules, section 
90A of the National Health Act provides the Minister with a discretionary power to 
substitute the Secretary’s decision to reject an application because it did not meet the 
requirements of the Location Rules, with a decision approving the pharmacist to 
supply pharmaceutical benefits at particular premises. 
 
Section 90B of the Act stipulates the process by which a pharmacist may request the 
Minister to exercise discretionary power under section 90A to substitute a decision by 
the Secretary to not approve a pharmacist for the purpose of supplying pharmaceutical 
benefits at particular premises with a decision approving the pharmacist. 
 
These amendments reduce the timeframe in which the Minister may exercise this 
power by replacing the current two stage process (which can take up to three months 
for each stage), with a single stage process of up to four months. This will reduce the 
significant administrative burden on staff resources and provide the community with 
more timely access to pharmaceutical benefits in circumstances where the Minister 
approves a request to exercise the discretionary power. 
 
In circumstances where the Minister decides not to exercise discretion to approve a 
request, the amendments prevent the applicant from making another request to the 
Minister for the same premises as the initial request, within 12 months of the initial 
request to the Minister, as the circumstances are unlikely to have changed. 
 
Delegation of form 
 
Subsection 90B(2) of the National Health Act provides that the Minister may 
determine the form in which a request to the Minister to approve a pharmacist under 
the section must be made. If the Minister does so, such a request must be made on that 
form. This function cannot currently be delegated and therefore any changes to the 
form must be approved by the Minister. 
 
The amendments enable the power to determine the form to be delegated. This will 
remove the need for the Minister to approve what is essentially an administrative 
matter and allow more timely changes to be made to the form as required. 
 
Australian Community Pharmacy Authority membership term 
 
Section 99N of the National Health Act specifies the make-up of the membership of 
the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority (Authority), and the term of 
5 
appointment at subsection 99N(5). The process for seeking nominations and 
subsequent endorsement of the nominees is administratively burdensome on 
nominating organisations and the Australian Government. The amendments increase 
the membership term from two years to three years, which will provide greater 
stability to the Authority and reduce administrative burden on nominating 
organisations and the Australian Government. 
 
Measures under the Therapeutic Goods Act 
 
The Therapeutic Goods Act provides for the establishment and maintenance of a 
national system of controls for the quality, safety, efficacy or performance, and timely 
availability of therapeutic goods that are used in, or exported from, Australia. It also 
provides for the establishment and maintenance of a national system of controls for 
the importation, manufacture, supply, commercial possession, advertising and export 
of vaping goods. The Therapeutic Goods Act is administered by the Therapeutic 
Goods Administration (TGA) within the Department. 
 
The amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act are principally intended to: 
 
• enhance the Department’s capacity to manage and alleviate the consequences 
of therapeutic goods shortages; 
 
• support compliance and enforcement activities by: 
 
broadening the circumstances in which section 52AAA is enlivened, to 
ensure that the forfeiture arrangements in that provision apply in relation to 
the range of circumstances in which goods may be seized under the 
Therapeutic Goods Act, rather than, as currently, only under a warrant 
issued under section 50; 
 
− revising several provisions in Part 6-2 that deal with entry to and searches 
of premises, as well as warrants to undertake such action, to ensure they 
are better aligned with the model provisions of the Regulatory Powers 
(Standard Provisions) Act 2014 (the Regulatory Powers Act); 
 
− appropriately lowering the threshold that must be satisfied before the 
Secretary may give an enforceable direction to a person under section 
42YT, from the current requirement that a direction is necessary to protect 
the health and safety of humans, with a more balanced approach that a 
direction must be considered in the interests of public health and safety—
better ensuring the availability of such directions to protect Australians 
from new and emerging public health threats; 
 
− enabling certain state and territory officers to issue notices requiring 
persons to give specified information, or to produce specified documents, 
that are relevant to a contravention or possible contravention of the 
Therapeutic Goods Act; 
 
6 
− clarify that section 61, which authorises the release of information in 
relation to therapeutic goods and vaping goods in certain circumstances, is 
not a secrecy provision; 
 
• reflect that the Secretary’s power under section 7 of the Therapeutic Goods 
Act to declare that a good meets, or does not meet, the definition of a 
‘therapeutic good' under the Act is legislative in nature, and that therefore the 
Secretary’s power should not be subject to an application process or to merits 
review of decisions to refuse to make, vary or repeal a legislative instrument 
made under section 7  declaring goods to be, or not to be, therapeutic goods; 
 
• update the power in section 63 to make regulations under the Therapeutic 
Goods Act to align with other provisions in that Act, and the terms of the 
Legislation Act 2003, by ensuring that the regulations may prescribe matters 
by reference to ‘other writing’ as in force or existing from time to time, 
alongside the existing power to make regulations prescribing matters by 
reference to an instrument in force or existing from time to time; 
 
• introduce a consolidated set of tiered offences and a civil penalty for breaching 
a condition of an exemption, or certain approvals or authorisations to access 
biologicals that are not included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic 
Goods (the Register), to align with equivalent provisions in the Therapeutic 
Goods Act for medicines and medical devices; 
 
• ensure consistency of the Secretary’s power to cancel the registration or listing 
of medicines from the Register that are also covered by an exemption, with 
other cancellation powers in the Therapeutic Goods Act (in some instances 
medicines that are covered by an exemption may inadvertently be registered or 
listed – the amendment would ensure the power to remove such products, as 
they do not need to be in the Register to be lawfully supplied, because they are 
exempt); 
 
• remove the Secretary’s obligation to publish in the Gazette or on the 
Department’s website the names of authorised persons under the Therapeutic 
Goods Act and its regulations, given privacy and safety concerns of affected 
persons; 
 
• enable regulations to be made under the Therapeutic Goods Act that prescribe 
circumstances in which the Secretary must not grant an authority to a medical 
practitioner under the Authorised Prescriber pathway for accessing therapeutic 
goods that are not included in the Register, to protect patients from products 
that may not be safe or effective; and 
 
• clarify that, if the regulations prescribe a fee in connection with the Secretary’s 
power to grant consents under sections 14, 14A, 32BF, 41RC, 41MA, and 
41MAA, payment of that fee is a pre-condition to the exercise of the 
Secretary’s power to give the consent. 
 
The Bill also amends the Therapeutic Goods Act to make minor consequential 
amendments to support the Government's vaping reforms. These amendments: 
7 
 
• enable the making of regulations to prohibit dealings in vaping goods that are 
the subject of an international agreement to which Australia is a party; 
 
• clarify that the authority under which the Secretary may determine that the 
supply of exempt therapeutic vaping goods should be ceased resides in the 
regulations; 
 
• enable the Secretary to issue a direction under Part 5-1A in relation to the 
dissemination of generic information about vaping goods, including a 
direction to cease the dissemination; and 
 
• clarify that the dissemination of generic information about vaping goods is 
regulated under Part 5-1A, rather than Part 5-1, of the Therapeutic Goods Act. 
 
Measures under the Tobacco Act  
 
The Tobacco Act consolidated a number of Acts and instruments, including eight 
different tobacco-related Acts, legislative instruments and court decisions 
administered across the Health and Treasury portfolios. The measures have been 
streamlined and modernised to strengthen Australia’s regulation of tobacco products 
in line with international best practice. 
 
The Bill amends the Tobacco Act to: 
 
• ensure that all Australian Public Service (APS) employees are eligible to be 
authorised officers under the Tobacco Act; 
 
• enable the making of regulations to facilitate smooth phase in and phase out 
of future series of regulated tobacco product requirements; 
 
• ensure corporations are captured by tobacco and e-cigarette sponsorship 
prohibitions; and 
 
• clarify the interaction between the Tobacco Act and the Therapeutic Goods 
Act regarding e-cigarette (also known as vaping goods) advertising 
prohibitions, following the vaping reforms introduced under the Therapeutic 
Goods and Other Legislation (Vaping Reforms) Act 2024. The amendments: 
o make clear that the advertising of vaping goods (including 
e-cigarette- products) is concurrently prohibited under the Tobacco 
Act and the Therapeutic Goods Act; and 
o remove certain exceptions and permissions in relation to e-cigarette 
advertising to better harmonise the Tobacco Act e-cigarette 
advertising prohibition with the Therapeutic Goods Act vaping goods 
advertising framework.

Financial Impact Statement 
 
The measure in this Bill reducing the timeframe for making bulk-billed claims 
involves savings of up to $33.6 million. 
 
The Government will provide $82.0 million over four years from 2023-24 to support 
the vaping reforms, awareness raising and enforcement activities. Funding includes: 
 
• $56.9 million over two years from 2023-24 to the Therapeutic Goods 
Administration to support regulatory development activities; and 
 
• $25.0 million over two years from 2023-24 to support the Australian Border 
Force’s regulatory and enforcement activities. 
 
This measure builds on the 2023-24 Budget measure titled Vaping Regulation Reform 
and Smoking Cessation Package. The package committed to ban all vapes, other than 
therapeutic vapes imported, manufactured or supplied in accordance with the 
Therapeutic Goods Act. 
 
The Government is implementing a comprehensive range of measures in partnership 
with states and territories to reduce smoking and vaping through stronger legislation, 
enforcement, education and support. The vaping reforms support the Government’s 
implementation of the National Tobacco Strategy 2023-2030 and complement related 
initiatives on vaping and smoking prevention and cessation support. 
 
Other measures in the Bill are expected to result in increased recovery of amounts to 
the Commonwealth but have not been specifically costed. 
 
Impact analysis 
 
The Office of Impact Analysis has been consulted on the measures relating to 
Medicare integrity and has advised that these are unlikely to have more than minor 
impacts and an impact analysis is not required (OIA24-06731, OIA23-05273 and 
OIA24-07309. 
 
An impact analysis was prepared on the proposed reforms to the regulation of vapes 
in October 2023 based on the feedback received from stakeholders and the Australian 
public. The Office of Impact Analysis assessed the impact analysis and determined 
that it was consistent with good practice and met Australian Government best practice 
regulation requirements (OBPR23-03933). 
 
The Office of Impact Analysis was further consulted in relation to the non-vaping 
measures under the Therapeutic Goods Act and advised that an impact analysis is not 
required in relation to the proposed amendments (OBPR23-03933; OIA23-05975; 
OIA24-07685 and OIA24-07914). 
 
Likewise, the Office of Impact Analysis was consulted in relation to the proposed 
amendments to the Tobacco Act and advised an impact analysis is not required as the 
amendments are considered minor or machinery in nature (OIA24-08305). An Impact 
9 
Analysis was prepared for the initial Public Health (Tobacco and Other Products) 
Act 2023 (OBPR22-02938). 
 
Consultation  
 
The Department consulted with the Attorney-General's Department (AGD), the 
Department of Social Services, Services Australia, the Commonwealth Director of 
Public Prosecutions, and the Professional Services Review Agency in relation to the 
Medicare integrity measures. The Philip Review, which forms the policy basis for the 
amendments, conducted broad consultation with professional medical associations. 
 
Between November and December 2023, the Department consulted with a range of 
stakeholders about the proposed amendment to clarify section 61 of the Therapeutic 
Goods Act (which permits the release of information) is not a ‘secrecy’ provision. 
Invitations for comment on this measure were sent to 31 stakeholders, including state 
and territory health departments, and a number of industry representative bodies. 
While most respondents have no concerns with this measure, Medicines Australia and 
Complementary Medicines Australia opposed it, principally on the basis that they 
considered it to be unnecessary. 
 
The Department consulted AGD in relation to the other therapeutic goods and vaping 
goods measures, including on the proposed amendments relating to forfeiture 
arrangements, enforceable directions, delegations, and aligning the offence and civil 
penalty provisions for breaching a condition of an exemption, approval or authority to 
access unapproved biologicals with the equivalent measures for unapproved 
medicines and medical devices. AGD was generally supportive of these measures. 
 
AGD recommended the Department undertake a privacy impact assessment to support 
the proposed amendments to the Secretary’s delegation power under the Therapeutic 
Goods Act as those amendments would increase the entities who may collect, use, 
disclose and retain personal information, and may also include the handling of 
sensitive personal information. 
 
The Department also consulted with state and territory agencies whose officers have 
regulatory functions relating to the compliance and enforcement of vaping goods 
under the Therapeutic Goods Act and its regulations. Overall, jurisdictions were 
supportive of the proposed amendments to the Secretary’s delegation power, noting 
the amendments would enhance their ability to monitor, investigate and enforce 
compliance with the Therapeutic Goods Act and its regulations. Several jurisdictions 
also noted that the proposed amendments and the associated powers were similar in 
nature to provisions that are currently in place under their respective legislation and 
are routinely used. 
 
Each jurisdiction was also consulted on whether or not it would be practical to limit 
these powers to Senior Executive Service (or equivalent) officers, which AGD had 
also recommended as a way of managing any privacy risks. One jurisdiction – 
Queensland – expressly stated it would not be practical to do so. Other jurisdictions 
were agreeable to limiting the exercise of relevant powers to Senior Executive Service 
(or equivalent) officers, or otherwise did not respond. 
 
10 
In the absence of any consensus, the Department intends to consider other 
mechanisms to protect privacy prior to delegating the relevant powers to state and 
territory officers. This includes making a direction under the Therapeutic Goods Act 
to require that delegates must take reasonable steps to limit the collection of personal 
information (unless relevant to an investigation), and must make best efforts to 
comply with the requirements of the Commonwealth Privacy Act (or similar). 
 
The Department has not undertaken any consultation in relation to the other proposed 
amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act, as those amendments are minor, 
machinery or consequential in nature, or would otherwise correct an error. 
 
The Department consulted extensively on the Tobacco Act. It has not been considered 
necessary to further consult on the proposed amendments to the Tobacco Act in this 
Bill as the amendments are clarifications consistent with original policy intent.

Statement of Compatibility with Human Rights 
 
Prepared in accordance with Part 3 of the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 
2011 
 
HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (IMPROVED MEDICARE 
INTEGRITY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2024 
 
This Bill is compatible with the human rights and freedoms recognised or declared in 
the international instruments listed in section 3 of the Human Rights (Parliamentary 
Scrutiny) Act 2011. 
Overview of the Bill 
 
Measures under the Health Insurance Act 1973, National Health Act 1953, Dental 
Benefits Act 2008, and Human Services (Medicare) Act 1973. 
 
The Health Legislation Amendment (Improved Medicare Integrity and Other 
Measures) Bill 2024 (the Bill) amends the National Health Act 1953 (National Health 
Act), Health Insurance Act 1973 (Health Insurance Act), Human Services (Medicare) 
Act 1973 (Human Services (Medicare) Act), and Dental Benefits Act 2008 (Dental 
Benefits Act) to protect the integrity and support the ongoing sustainability of 
Australia’s health benefits schemes, including the Medicare Benefits Schedule 
(MBS), Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), and the Child Dental Benefits 
Schedule (CDBS). It does so by addressing issues that are currently inhibiting the 
ability of the Department of Health and Aged Care to conduct efficient, timely, and 
effective compliance activities. 
 
The amendments relating to Medicare integrity are principally intended to: 
 
• improve payment integrity and reduce the number of incorrect and 
fraudulently made claims by changing the timeframe for making Medicare 
claims for bulk-billed services from 2 years to 1 year; 
 
• update and broaden investigative powers to ensure they can be used 
consistently, effectively, and appropriately across health benefits schemes and 
in relation to a broader number of offences; and 
 
• improve pharmacy approval processes by making the processes simpler and 
more efficient. 
 
Measures under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 
 
The Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (the Therapeutic Goods Act) provides for the 
establishment and maintenance of a national system of controls for the quality, safety, 
efficacy or performance, and timely availability of therapeutic goods that are used in, 
or exported from, Australia. It also provides for the establishment and maintenance of 
a national system of controls for the importation, manufacture, supply, commercial 
possession, advertising and export of vaping goods. The Therapeutic Goods Act is 
administered by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) within the Department. 
12 
 
The amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act are principally intended to: 
 
• enhance the Department’s capacity to manage and alleviate the consequences 
of therapeutic goods shortages; 
 
• support compliance and enforcement activities by: 
 
− broadening the circumstances in which section 52AAA is enlivened, to 
ensure that the forfeiture arrangements in that provision apply in relation to 
the range of circumstances in which goods may be seized under the 
Therapeutic Goods Act, rather than, as currently, only under a warrant 
issued under section 50; 
 
− revising several provisions in Part 6-2 that deal with entry to and searches 
of premises, as well as warrants to undertake such action, to ensure they 
are better aligned with the model provisions of the Regulatory Powers 
(Standard Provisions) Act 2014 (the Regulatory Powers Act); 
 
− appropriately lowering the threshold that must be satisfied before the 
Secretary may give an enforceable direction to a person under section 
42YT, from the current requirement that a direction is necessary to protect 
the health and safety of humans, with a more balanced approach that a 
direction must be considered in the interests of public health and safety—
better ensuring the availability of such directions to protect Australians 
from new and emerging public health threats; 
 
− enabling certain state and territory officers to issue notices requiring 
persons to give specified information, or to produce specified documents, 
that are relevant to a contravention or possible contravention of the 
Therapeutic Goods Act; 
 
− clarify that section 61, which authorises the release of information in 
relation to therapeutic goods and vaping goods in certain circumstances, is 
not a secrecy provision; 
 
• reflect that the Secretary’s power under section 7 of the Therapeutic Goods 
Act to declare that a good meets, or does not meet, the definition of a 
‘therapeutic good' under the Act is legislative in nature, and that therefore the 
Secretary’s power should not be subject to an application process or to merits 
review of decisions to refuse to make, vary or repeal a legislative instrument 
made under section 7  declaring goods to be, or not to be, therapeutic goods; 
 
• update the power in section 63 to make regulations under the Therapeutic 
Goods Act to align with other provisions in that Act, and the terms of the 
Legislation Act 2003, by ensuring that the regulations may prescribe matters 
by reference to ‘other writing’ as in force or existing from time to time, 
alongside the existing power to make regulations prescribing matters by 
reference to an instrument in force or existing from time to time; 
13 
 
• introduce a consolidated set of tiered offences and a civil penalty for breaching 
a condition of an exemption, or certain approvals or authorisations to access 
biologicals that are not included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic 
Goods (the Register), to align with equivalent provisions in the Therapeutic 
Goods Act for medicines and medical devices; 
 
• ensure consistency of the Secretary’s power to cancel the registration or listing 
of medicines from the Register that are also covered by an exemption, with 
other cancellation powers in the Therapeutic Goods Act (in some instances 
medicines that are covered by an exemption may inadvertently be registered or 
listed – the amendment would ensure the power to remove such products, as 
they do not need to be in the Register to be lawfully supplied, because they are 
exempt); 
 
• remove the Secretary’s obligation to publish in the Gazette or on the 
Department’s website the names of authorised persons under the Therapeutic 
Goods Act and its regulations, given privacy and safety concerns of affected 
persons; 
 
• enable regulations to be made under the Therapeutic Goods Act that prescribe 
circumstances in which the Secretary must not grant an authority to a medical 
practitioner under the Authorised Prescriber pathway for accessing therapeutic 
goods that are not included in the Register, to protect patients from products 
that may not be safe or effective; and 
 
• clarify that, if the regulations prescribe a fee in connection with the Secretary’s 
power to grant consents under sections 14, 14A, 32BF, 41RC, 41MA, and 
41MAA, payment of that fee is a pre-condition to the exercise of the 
Secretary’s power to give the consent. 
 
The Bill also amends the Therapeutic Goods Act to make minor consequential 
amendments to support the Government's vaping reforms. These amendments: 
 
• enable the making of regulations to prohibit dealings in vaping goods that are 
the subject of an international agreement to which Australia is a party; 
 
• clarify that the authority under which the Secretary may determine that the 
supply of exempt therapeutic vaping goods should be ceased is in the 
regulations; 
 
• enable the Secretary to issue a direction under Part 5-1A in relation to the 
dissemination of generic information about vaping goods, including a 
direction to cease the dissemination; and 
 
• clarify that the dissemination of generic information about vaping goods is 
regulated under Part 5-1A, rather than Part 5-1, of the Therapeutic Goods Act. 
 
  
14 
Measures under the Public Health (Tobacco and Other Products) Act 2023 
 
The Public Health (Tobacco and Other Products) Act 2023 (the Tobacco Act) 
consolidated a number of instruments, including eight tobacco-related Acts, 
legislative instruments and court decisions administered across the Health and 
Treasury portfolios. The measures have been streamlined and modernised to 
strengthen Australia’s regulation of tobacco products in line with international best 
practice. 
 
The Bill amends the Tobacco Act to: 
 
• ensure that all Australian Public Service (APS) employees are eligible to be 
authorised officers under the Tobacco Act; 
 
• enable the making of regulations to facilitate smooth phase in and phase out 
of future series of regulated tobacco product requirements; 
 
• ensure corporations are captured by tobacco and e-cigarette sponsorship 
prohibitions; and 
 
• clarify the interaction between the Tobacco Act and the Therapeutic Goods 
Act regarding e-cigarette (also known as vaping goods) advertising 
prohibitions, following the vaping reforms introduced under the Therapeutic 
Goods and Other Legislation (Vaping Reforms) Act 2024. The amendments: 
o make clear that the advertising of vaping goods (including e-cigarette 
products) is concurrently prohibited under the Tobacco Act and the 
Therapeutic Goods Act; and 
o remove certain exceptions and permissions in relation to e-cigarette 
advertising to better harmonise the Tobacco Act e-cigarette 
advertising prohibition with the Therapeutic Goods Act vaping goods 
advertising framework. 
 
Human rights implications 
 
Measures under the Health Insurance Act 1973, National Health Act 1953, Dental 
Benefits Act 2008, and Human Services (Medicare) Act 1973 
 
The Bill engages the following human rights in relation to the proposed amendments 
to the Health Insurance Act 1973, National Health Act 1953, Dental Benefits Act 
2008, and Human Services (Medicare) Act 1973: 
 
• the right to health under Article 12 of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR); 
 
• the right to social security under article 9 of the ICESCR; and 
 
• the right to privacy under Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights (ICCPR). 
 
15 
Right to health 
 
The Bill engages the right to health. Article 12(1) of the ICESCR promotes the right 
of all individuals to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 
health. The Bill assists with the progressive realisation of the right of all individuals to 
enjoy this high standard by strengthening and protecting the integrity of Australia’s 
health benefits schemes. In doing so, the Bill supports the ongoing sustainability and 
effectiveness of these schemes, and therefore ensures that Australians can continue to 
access affordable, efficient and high-quality healthcare. 
 
Strong health benefits schemes are fundamental to Australia’s world-class health 
system and the positive healthcare outcomes it delivers for patients. The Bill supports 
these schemes, and therefore the broader health system, by enhancing the compliance 
systems and processes that enable: 
 
• the prevention, identification, and response to instances of non-compliance, 
and fraud, in relation to health benefits schemes; 
 
• access to health benefits through health benefits schemes; 
 
• access to safe, high-quality, and affordable health services, including access to 
pharmacy services; 
 
• the effective and appropriate prosecution of serious cases of non-compliance 
that risk Commonwealth funds, as well as patient safety and wellbeing; and 
 
• the recovery of incorrect payments. 
  
These functions are essential to ensuring that the public funds invested in health 
benefits schemes are utilised for their intended purpose: providing Australians with 
access to quality care and improving healthcare outcomes. 
 
Right to social security 
  
The Bill engages Article 9 of the ICESCR which recognises the right to social 
security, including social insurance. 
  
The Bill safeguards the integrity of Australia’s health benefits schemes, primarily by 
strengthening the compliance activities that protect these schemes from fraud and 
other forms of misuse. Health benefits schemes, including Medicare, are a form of 
social security as they provide a government contribution to certain healthcare costs 
that Australians incur. By protecting the integrity of these schemes, the Bill ensures 
that they are sustainable and can therefore continue to provide Australians with access 
to affordable, high quality, Government-supported healthcare. 
 
Right to privacy 
 
The Bill engages the protection against arbitrary or unlawful interference with 
privacy. Article 17 of the ICCPR prohibits arbitrary or unlawful interference with an 
16 
individual’s privacy, family, home or correspondence, and protects a person’s honour 
and reputation from unlawful attacks. The right to privacy can be limited to achieve a 
legitimate objective where the limitations are lawful and not arbitrary. 
 
For interference with the right to privacy to be permissible, the interference must be 
authorised by law, be for a reason consistent with the ICCPR and be reasonable in the 
circumstances. 
 
The Bill expands the range of offences in relation to which the investigative powers in 
the Human Services Medicare Act can be used. The amendments will allow 
investigators to investigate, and seize evidence, in relation to a broader range of 
offences – including significant and serious offences in the Criminal Code. 
Investigators will also have consistent powers in relation to all offences in the Dental 
Benefits Act, Health Insurance Act and National Health Act. 
 
It is recognised that coercive powers (including the power to search a premises and 
seize data, and the power to issue a coercive notice) may have a significant impact on 
the privacy of an individual suspected of committing an offence. However, the Bill 
achieves a balance between individual rights and the effective performance of the 
Department’s functions in protecting the integrity of health payments. The coercive 
powers already include appropriate safeguards to protect individual rights – for 
example, there are existing restrictions on when a warrant can be issued, and how an 
officer must conduct themselves while exercising any of their powers. These 
restrictions, as well as accountability and oversight mechanisms, are already in place 
and will be appropriately applied to the amendments. This includes the guidelines and 
training in place for all authorised officers exercising powers under Part IID of the 
Human Services Medicare Act, as well as departmental approval and record-keeping 
requirements for all uses of these powers. 
 
The Bill does not seek to increase the powers to give the Department the same powers 
given to the police in the Crimes Act 1914 – for example, there is no power to arrest 
or to use physical force against a person. 
 
The amendments to the definition of relevant offence will apply to conduct (including 
an omission) which constitutes a relevant offence, whether the conduct occurs before, 
on or after commencement. This therefore enables investigative powers to be used 
where a person undertakes conduct constituting a relevant offence, regardless of 
whether that conduct would be considered to be a ‘relevant offence’ at the time. It is 
important to note, however, that no new offences are being created and the underlying 
offences are not being changed. In addition, no retrospective criminal liability is 
created, as the amendments will affect the ability to investigate existing offences and 
expand the coercive powers of investigators but will not render unlawful conduct that 
previously was not an offence. There is a legitimate public interest in being able to 
investigate relevant offences even when the conduct occurred prior to the 
commencement. This is necessary to ensure that Commonwealth expenditure is 
protected. 
 
17 
Measures under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 
 
The Bill engages the following human rights in relation to the proposed amendments 
to the Therapeutic Goods Act: 
 
• the right to health under Article 12 of the ICESCR; 
 
• the right to privacy under Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights (ICCPR); 
 
• the right to freedom of expression under Article 19(2) of the ICCPR; 
 
• the right to a fair hearing under Article 14(1) of the ICCPR; and 
 
• the right to the presumption of innocence under Article 14(2) of the ICCPR. 
 
Right to health 
 
In General Comment No. 14: The Right to the Highest Attainable Standard of Health 
(Art. 12) (2000), the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights states that health is a ‘fundamental human right indispensable for the exercise 
of other human rights’, and that the right to health is not to be understood as the right 
to be healthy, but includes the right to a system of health protection which provides 
equal opportunity for people to enjoy the highest attainable level of health. 
 
The Bill principally supports the right to health through measures to: 
 
• enhance the effectiveness of the Secretary’s powers to address, and help 
alleviate, shortages of therapeutic goods, noting that medicines shortages 
continue to have a significant and concerning impact on public health in 
Australia; 
 
• improve the flexibility and effectiveness of compliance and enforcement 
powers under the Therapeutic Goods Act to address and remove unlawful and 
unsafe therapeutic and vaping goods from the market, protecting Australians 
from these harmful products. In particular, the measures improve the 
flexibility and effectiveness of powers under which goods may be forfeited to 
the Commonwealth, better align entry, search and seizure powers with the 
model provisions of the Regulatory Powers Act, enable enforceable directions 
to be given in the interests of public health and safety, enable state and 
territory officers to issue notices requiring persons to give specified 
information to a person, and expand the circumstances in which a person may 
assist an authorised person undertaking a search of premises; 
 
• ensure that the regulations may prohibit the importation, exportation, 
manufacture and supply of vaping goods that may in the future be the subject 
of an international agreement to which Australia is a party; and 
 
18 
• ensure that provisions of the Therapeutic Goods Act addressing the unlawful 
supply, possession, advertising and dissemination of generic information 
relating to, vaping goods, are clear and unambiguous. 
 
Right to privacy 
 
The Bill engages the protection against arbitrary or unlawful interference with 
privacy. Article 17 of the ICCPR prohibits arbitrary or unlawful interference with an 
individual’s privacy, family, home or correspondence, and protects a person’s honour 
and reputation from unlawful attacks. The right to privacy can be limited to achieve a 
legitimate objective where the limitations are lawful and not arbitrary. 
 
For interference with the right to privacy to be permissible, the interference must be 
authorised by law, be for a reason consistent with the ICCPR and be reasonable in the 
circumstances. The United Nations Human Rights Committee has interpreted the 
requirement of ‘reasonableness’ as implying that any interference with privacy must 
be proportionate to a legitimate end and be necessary in the circumstances. 
 
The Bill provides for the collection, use and disclosure of information, which may 
include personal information. These provisions engage, and may potentially limit, the 
right to privacy. The proposed information gathering, reporting and release measures 
are reasonable, necessary and proportionate to a legitimate objective of supporting the 
effective implementation of the vaping reforms for a public health objective. 
 
The Bill makes amendments to the arrangements relating to the forfeiture of things 
under section 52AAA of the Therapeutic Goods Act, to provide that section 52AAA 
applies not only in relation to things that are seized under a warrant issued under 
section 50, but also in relation to things that are seized under other provisions in 
Part 6‑2 (Entry, searches and warrants). 
 
In so doing, these amendments may engage the right to privacy in Article 17 of the 
ICCPR. To the extent that it may limit this right, the limitation is provided for by law 
and is necessary to ensure the efficiency with which the Department may disrupt the 
trafficking of unlawful and potentially dangerous therapeutic goods and vaping goods. 
The forfeiture of specified things or goods are subject to judicial review and may be 
challenged by the person who owns or possesses the products. 
 
Further, although Part 6-2 of the Therapeutic Goods Act sets out a range of 
circumstances in which powers may be exercised in relation to the searching of 
premises and seizure of things, individuals are protected against arbitrary interference 
with privacy. 
 
In general, the entry, search and seizure powers cannot be exercised without the 
person affected being fully informed, a voluntary consent of the occupier of the 
premises being provided by the affected person, or the presence of a prior 
authorisation in the form of a warrant. There are exceptions to these in circumstances 
where an authorised person exercises entry and seizure powers in the interests of 
public health to avoid an imminent risk of death, serious illness or serious injury 
(section 46B of the Therapeutic Goods Act refers). 
 
19 
As such, any interference with an individual’s privacy that may be said to be enabled 
under the Therapeutic Goods Act in connection with the broadening of the forfeiture 
arrangements as a result of the Bill would not be an arbitrary inference within the 
meaning of Article 17 of the ICCPR. 
 
Separately, the Bill engages the right to privacy in relation to the proposed 
amendments to permit the delegation of the Secretary’s information gathering powers 
under the following provisions in Part 6-1A of the Therapeutic Goods Act to relevant 
state or territory officers: 
 
• section 45AB—which provides that the Secretary may, by written notice, 
require a person to give any information, or produce any documents, specified 
in the notice that are relevant to a contravention, or possible contravention, of 
a provision of the Therapeutic Goods Act or its regulations; 
• section 45AF—which provides that the Secretary may inspect a document that 
is produced under section 45AB and make and retain copies of the whole or a 
part of the document; 
• section 45AG—which provides that the Secretary may take possession of a 
document produced under section 45AB and keep that document for as long as 
is reasonably necessary. 
 
Section 45AB is intended to be used where the Secretary has reason to believe that a 
person has information or documents that would be peculiarly within the person’s 
knowledge or possession, and which may relate to the Secretary’s investigation of a 
contravention or suspected contravention of the Therapeutic Goods Act or its 
regulations. Such information or documents may, for example, include records 
evidencing payments for the supply of unlawful vaping goods, or information from a 
person with knowledge relating to the business arrangements for the distribution and 
retail supply of unlawful vaping goods. 
 
The Secretary’s current inability to delegate their powers and functions under these 
sections 45AB, 45AF and 45AG limits the extent to which the states and territories 
can effectively monitor, investigate and enforce compliance with the Therapeutic 
Goods Act and its regulations, to ensure the safety of therapeutic goods for 
Australians. 
 
As the effect of this amendment is to broaden the range of persons to whom the 
Secretary may delegate the Secretary’s powers under sections 45AB, 45AF and 45AG 
of the Therapeutic Goods Act, a corollary is that the number of entities who may 
collect, use, disclose and retain personal information will also likely increase. 
 
To ensure that the collection of information under these provisions, and any 
subsequent use, storage or disclosure of such information, is reasonable, necessary 
and proportionate, the TGA will, prior to the delegation of these powers to state and 
territory officers: 
 
• undertake a privacy impact assessment in relation to the specifically proposed 
delegations; 
20 
• consult with state and territory agencies in order to satisfy itself that 
appropriate processes are in place to collect, store and protect personal 
information obtained under sections 45AB, 45AF or 45AG; 
• consider issuing directions under subsection 57(12) of the Therapeutic Goods 
Act requiring state and territory officers exercising these powers to, for 
example: 
− minimise the personal information collected under these powers; 
− take certain measures to store and protect personal information collected; 
and 
− report to the TGA where personal information is collected. 
 
This approach will complement current processes concerning checks and balances 
concerning the authorisation of state and territory officers and the delegation of 
powers, including ensuring that those to whom powers are delegated are of an 
appropriate level of seniority within their respective agency. 
 
Indeed, it is anticipated that these powers will only be delegated to senior 
investigating officers within relevant health authorities, police forces and other state 
and territory agencies engaged in the regulation and investigation of vaping goods and 
therapeutic goods. 
 
Right to freedom of expression 
 
The Bill contains a small number of minor amendments in relation to the advertising 
and dissemination of generic information relating to vaping goods. Article 19(2) of 
the ICCPR engages the right to freedom of expression, which extends to any medium, 
including written and oral communications, the media, public protest, broadcasting 
and artistic works, and may include commercial advertising. 
 
Article 19(3) of the ICCPR states that public health is a basis on which the right to 
freedom of expression can be limited. This right may be limited as provided for by 
law and when necessary for respect of the rights or reputations of others, for the 
protection of national security, public order, or of public health or morals. Limitations 
must be prescribed by legislation necessary to achieve the desired purpose and 
proportionate to the need on which the limitation is predicated. 
 
The Bill makes a small number of amendments to Parts 5-1 and 5-1A of the 
Therapeutic Goods Act to ensure their effective operation and to provide relevant 
stakeholders with clarity about prohibitions and regulatory requirements concerning 
advertising, and the dissemination of generic information, about vaping goods. 
 
In particular, the amendments clarify that Part 5-1 of the Therapeutic Goods Act does 
not apply to the dissemination of generic information in relation to vaping goods that 
are therapeutic goods. Part 5-1A, which was introduced by the Vaping Reforms Act, 
makes specific provision for generic information in the context of vaping goods. It 
was not intended that “generic information” in relation to vaping goods that are 
therapeutic goods would be subject to two sets of regulatory requirements and 
prohibitions under Part 5-1 and Part 5-1A of the Therapeutic Goods Act. 
 
21 
The Bill also amends section 42DZK of the Therapeutic Goods Act, to make it clear 
that the Secretary may give directions in writing to a person apparently responsible 
for, or for causing, the dissemination of generic information about vaping goods to the 
public, or a section of the public, “if the Secretary is satisfied that it is in the interests 
of public health or safety to give the person the direction”. This measure is important 
to ensure that the Secretary may address and preclude a person from disseminating 
unlawful, and potentially harmful, generic information about vaping goods, for 
instance in relation to promoting the use of potentially dangerous vapes. 
 
These measures, in particular the proposed amendments to section 42DZK, may 
engage and limit the right to freedom of expression, which is protected by 
Article 19(2) of the ICCPR. However, such restrictions are directed to the purpose of 
reducing the presence and frequency of unlawful advertisement, and dissemination of 
generic information, about vaping goods. This is a legitimate public health objective 
to address the public health risks and accordingly the prohibition is necessary to 
achieve the desired purpose and proportionate to the need on which the limitation is 
predicated. 
 
The right to freedom of expression is not absolute. It carries special responsibilities 
and may be restricted on several grounds. Article 19(3) of the ICCPR expressly states 
that the right to freedom of expression may be subject to limitations necessary for the 
protection of public health. The limitation (if any) of the right to freedom of 
expression in the Bill aims to achieve a legitimate objective – the protection of public 
health – by contributing to efforts to reduce vaping rates and the associated health 
risks. This is of critical importance in relation to the advertising of vaping goods to 
youth and young adults by means of retail websites and social media. 
 
As such, the proposed amendments are designed to support a legitimate objective in 
relation to the protection of public health, and are reasonable, proportionate and 
necessary to the public health risk posed by vaping. 
 
Right to a fair hearing 
 
The Bill engages the right to a fair hearing under Article 14(1) of the ICCPR, in 
relation to amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act to introduce criminal offences 
and civil penalties relating to a breach of a condition of an exemption, approval or 
authority in respect of a therapeutic good that is a biological. The right to a fair 
hearing is a fundamental part of the rule of law and the proper administration of 
justice. The essential right guarantees equality before courts and tribunals, and, in the 
determination of criminal charges, or any suit at law, the right to a fair and public 
hearing before a competent, independent and impartial court or tribunals established 
by law. 
 
Those charged with a criminal offence have the rights set out in Articles 14(2) to (7), 
including the presumption of innocence and the guarantees set out in Article 14(2). 
The Bill engages this right and at the same time ensures that a defendant is provided 
with a right to a fair hearing before the relevant court, whether under an offence 
provision or a civil penalty provision. No provision relating to any of these offences 
seeks to displace or modify defendants’ fair hearing rights under Article 14. 
 
22 
The amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act include the introduction of new 
sections 32CP and 32CQ, which set out criminal offences and a civil penalty 
provision for the breach of a condition of an exemption, approval or authority in 
respect of the requirement for a biological to be entered in the Australian Register of 
Therapeutic Goods. Such mechanisms include, for instance, exemptions for 
biologicals supplied under certain kinds of clinical trials, and approvals for health 
practitioners to supply specified biologicals to their patients. 
 
New section 32CP includes fault-based offences and a strict liability offence for an act 
or omission that breaches such a condition. These include an offence for a breach that 
has resulted in, will result in or is likely to result in harm or injury to any person (or, 
in certain circumstances, has caused, will cause or is likely to cause a serious risk to 
public health) with a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years or 4,000 penalty 
units or both, an offence without an aggravating element with a maximum penalty of 
imprisonment for 12 months or 1,000 penalty units or both, and a strict liability 
offence with a maximum penalty of 100 penalty units. 
 
New section 32CQ sets out a corresponding civil penalty for the same conduct, with a 
maximum penalty of 5,000 penalty units for an individual and 50,000 penalty units for 
a body corporate. 
 
The Commonwealth will decide in each case whether to prosecute a person for a 
fault-based or strict liability offence, or whether to bring proceedings for a civil 
penalty order. Division 2 of Part 5A-1 of Chapter 5A of the Therapeutic Goods Act 
places restrictions on what kinds of proceedings can be brought against persons who 
are alleged to have contravened the Therapeutic Goods Act. These limitations broadly 
mirror those seen in Division 3 of Part 4 of the Regulatory Powers Act. 
 
The provision in the Therapeutic Goods Act relating to bringing criminal proceedings 
after civil penalty orders have been issued against a person is more restrictive than the 
provision that regulates the same situation in the Regulatory Powers Act. The 
limitations imposed by Division 2 of Part 5A-1 of Chapter 5A of the Therapeutic 
Goods Act will apply to the new offences and civil penalty provisions introduced by 
the Bill. 
 
Most relevantly: 
 
• section 42YF provides that the Federal Court must not make a pecuniary 
penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision 
if the person has been convicted of an offence constituted by conduct that is 
substantially the same as the conduct constituting the contravention; 
 
• section 42YG operates to stay civil proceedings if criminal proceedings 
commence or have commenced and relate to the same, or substantially the 
same, conduct. This is to prevent any information that arises during criminal 
proceedings prejudicing civil proceedings. If the criminal proceedings result in 
a conviction, civil proceedings related to the same, or substantially the same, 
conduct will be dismissed. Civil proceedings may resume if the person is not 
convicted of the offence; 
 
23 
• section 42YH prevents criminal proceedings being brought against a person 
for conduct that is substantially the same as conduct constituting a 
contravention of a civil penalty provision if a pecuniary penalty order has been 
made against the person in respect of that conduct; and 
 
• section 42YI provides that evidence given by an individual during proceedings 
for a civil penalty order cannot be used in any criminal proceedings against the 
same individual relating to the same conduct. This ensures that information or 
documents produced during civil proceedings are not relied upon to support 
subsequent criminal proceedings, unless those proceedings are criminal 
proceedings relating to falsifying evidence in civil proceedings. While it is 
appropriate to allow criminal proceedings after civil proceedings have ended, 
given the overriding importance of the criminal justice system, criminal 
proceedings not relating to the falsity of evidence must rely on evidence 
gathered during independent investigations, not evidence from prior civil 
proceedings. 
 
The Bill introduces, alongside the new criminal sanctions, a civil penalty provision for 
an act or omission that breaches a condition of an exemption, approval or authority in 
relation to a biological. A civil penalty is a punitive sanction of a financial nature and 
provisions imposing civil penalties do not specify aggravating elements and fault 
elements. The penalties are imposed through civil court proceedings rather than 
through the criminal prosecution process. A civil penalty takes the form of a monetary 
penalty only and does not result in any criminal conviction. 
 
A civil penalty is more appropriate to enable responsible persons to be fined for 
breaches of the Therapeutic Goods Act where other sanctions, such as criminal 
prosecution, may not be as effective or appropriate in the circumstances. The civil 
penalty regime is also intended to act as a deterrent to behavior that breaches 
regulatory requirements, and also to act as an incentive for persons to establish 
systems designed to avoid breaches of regulatory requirements. In these ways, the 
civil penalty scheme is intended to prevent instances where public health and safety 
is, or could be, placed in jeopardy. 
 
The focus of a civil penalty scheme is generally on the regulation of commercial 
activity. The inclusion of a civil penalty regime is proposed to strengthen enforcement 
options to deter non-compliance with regulatory requirements by persons whose main 
objective is monetary profit. 
 
The levels of these penalties have been set having regard not just in relation to the 
significant potential impact on the health of patients who may need to use an 
unapproved biological, but also to deter the risk of perpetrators standing to make 
financial gain from dealing with unlawful and potentially unsafe biologicals. The 
potential monetary benefit of unlawful dealings with vaping goods is significant. The 
objective is, for the benefit of good health outcomes for consumers, to incentivise 
those who have the most to gain by breaching the Therapeutic Goods Act to comply 
with regulatory requirements. 
 
Prescribing conduct that is subject to a civil penalty could engage criminal process 
rights if the imposition of civil penalties is classified as ‘criminal’ under international 
24 
human rights law. Guidance Note 2: Offence provisions, civil penalties and human 
rights (December 2014), which is published by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on 
Human Rights, states that civil penalty provisions may engage criminal process rights 
under Articles 14 and 15 of the ICCPR, regardless of the distinction between criminal 
and civil penalties in domestic law. 
 
When a provision imposes a civil penalty, an assessment is required as to whether it 
amounts to a ‘criminal’ penalty for the purposes of the ICCPR. Determining whether 
penalties could be criminal under international human rights law requires 
consideration of the classification of the penalty provisions under Australian domestic 
law, the nature and purpose of the penalties, and the severity of the penalties. 
 
New section 32CQ is expressly classified as a civil penalty for the purposes of 
Australian domestic law, and will not impose criminal liability. For several reasons, 
this civil penalty provision is unlikely to be considered criminal for the purposes of 
human rights. These include that it is not classified or identified as criminal under the 
Therapeutic Goods Act. Rather, it functions as an alternative to criminal prosecution, 
and does not carry a sanction for imprisonment for non-payment. Further, a finding of 
breach in connection with section 32CQ will not lead to the creation of a criminal 
record. Section 32CQ forms part of an enforcement regime to incentivise those who 
may otherwise seek to gain by not complying with conditions, to comply for the 
benefit of public health. As such, the criminal process rights under Articles 14 and 15 
of the ICCPR are unlikely to apply. 
 
The civil penalty provisions in the Bill are principally intended to provide an effective 
deterrent to non-compliance, and to reflect the serious potential impact on public 
health of non-compliance. Prosecution of a person for contravention of a civil penalty 
provision will generally only be considered after other available compliance measures 
have been considered, for instance the giving of an infringement notice. 
 
The maximum penalties under new section 32CQ are commensurate to the public 
health risks associated with the use of unapproved biologicals, which have not been 
the subject of pre-market scrutiny by the TGA, in relation to which a condition of the 
terms of their exemption, approval or authority has been breached. This civil penalty 
is not directed to members of the public in general but only to those in relation to 
whom an exemption, approval or authority applies, for instance a clinical trial 
sponsor. The maximum penalty levels are consistent with the equivalent civil 
penalties in the Therapeutic Goods Act for breaching a condition of an exemption, 
approval or authority in respect of a medicine or device (sections 22AA and 41MNA 
refer). 
 
For the reasons outlined above, the civil penalty in new section 32CQ is appropriately 
classified as a civil penalty and not a criminal measure for the purposes of human 
rights law. Further, a person who is the subject of a civil penalty proceeding has a 
right to a fair hearing before a competent, independent, and impartial court as 
provided for under the current Part 5A-1 (civil penalties) under Chapter 5A of the 
Therapeutic Goods Act, which supports compatibility with the right to a fair hearing 
under Article 14(1) of the ICCPR. 
 
25 
The right to the presumption of innocence under Article 14(2) 
 
Article 14(2) of the ICCPR provides that everyone charged with a criminal offence 
shall have the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law. The 
right to presumption of innocence is also a fundamental common law principle. This 
right is engaged in relation to the introduction of a strict liability offence in the 
Therapeutic Goods Act for a breach of an exemption, approval or authority involving 
a biological (new subsection 32CP(3)) by Part 7 of Schedule 2 to the Bill. 
 
Strict liability offences can be considered a limitation of the presumption of innocence 
because the defendant can be found guilty without the prosecution being required to 
prove fault. 
 
When strict liability applies to an offence, the prosecution is only required to prove 
the physical elements of an offence, not the fault elements, beyond reasonable doubt 
for the defendant to be found guilty. The defence of honest and reasonable mistake of 
fact is available to the defendant (see section 9.2 of the Criminal Code). 
 
The inclusion of a strict liability offence at new subsection 32CP(3) for a breach of an 
exemption, approval or authority in relation to a biological is a purposeful deterrence 
measure. A requirement for the prosecution to prove the existence of a fault element, 
such as intention or recklessness, would not adequately protect the public from the 
supply, and advertising for supply, of biologicals in such circumstances, particularly if 
the breach involves non-compliance with a condition designed to ensure the safety of 
the biological for patients. 
 
The strict liability provision in subsection 32CP(3) is compatible with Article 14(2) of 
the ICCPR, as it pursues a legitimate objective in acting as a deterrent to behaviour 
that may otherwise represent a risk to patients, in relation to potentially unsafe 
biologicals, and as such the provision is reasonable and proportionate in achieving 
that outcome. Where the prosecution is satisfied that the defendant is culpable and the 
relevant fault elements such as intention and recklessness can be established, the 
normal fault-based offence could be pursued. 
 
Measures under the Tobacco Act  
 
The measures under the Tobacco Act engage the following human rights: 
 
• right to health under Article 12 of the ICESCR; 
 
• right to life under Article 6 of the ICCPR;  
 
• right to freedom of expression under Article 19(2) of the ICCPR; 
 
• right to a fair trial and fair hearing rights under Article 14(1) of the 
ICCPR; and 
 
• right to a presumption of innocence under Article 14(2) of the ICCPR. 
 
26 
Right to health 
 
Article 12(2)(c) of the ICESCR requires States Parties to take steps to achieve the full 
realisation of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard 
of physical and mental health, including those steps necessary for the prevention, 
treatment and control of diseases. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights considers that this “requires the establishment of prevention and education 
programmes for behaviour related health-concerns…and the promotion of social 
determinants of good health”.  
 
The Tobacco Act, including the amendments, promotes the right to health by aiming, 
through the achievement of the Tobacco Act’s objectives, and as part of a 
comprehensive range of tobacco control measures, to contribute to efforts to reduce 
smoking rates and thereby reduce the significant health, social and economic effects 
of tobacco use.  
 
Right to life 
 
The measures contained in the Tobacco Act, supported by the Regulations, promote 
the right to life by seeking to reduce the incidence of smoking and vaping. These 
amendments are consistent with ensuring the effective operation of the Tobacco Act.  
 
Tobacco use causes more deaths than any other behavioural risk factor. Up to two 
thirds of deaths in tobacco smokers can be attributed to smoking, and long term‑ 
smokers die an average of 10 years earlier than non-smokers. Exposure to 
second‑hand smoke is also a cause of preventable death and disability in adults and 
children. Tobacco use and exposure among pregnant people and their babies is one of 
the most prevalent preventable causes of infant death and illness and of adverse 
pregnancy outcomes including preterm birth and still‑birth.￼ 
 
Tobacco smoking by youth and young adults has immediate adverse health 
consequences and accelerates the development of chronic diseases across the full life 
course. It can lead to nicotine addiction that causes young people to continue smoking 
for longer, causing increased physical damage. In addition, quitting smoking at any 
age reduces the risk of premature death and improves quality of life. 
 
The Tobacco Act, including the amendments, promote the right to life by seeking, 
through the achievement of the Tobacco Act’s objectives and the intended effect of 
the measures, to deter the uptake of smoking as well as vaping and the use of 
e-cigarette products, and to encourage people who smoke and vape to quit. 
 
Right to freedom of expression 
 
The restrictions in relation to advertising and sponsorship, provided for by the 
Tobacco Act and Therapeutic Goods Act may engage Article 19 of the ICCPR. 
Article 19(2) of the ICCPR engages the right to freedom of expression, which extends 
to any medium, including written and oral communications, the media, public protest, 
broadcasting and artistic works, and may include commercial advertising. 
 
27 
Article 19(3)(b) of the ICCPR states that public health is a basis on which the right to 
freedom of expression can be limited. This right may be limited as provided for by 
law and when necessary for respect of the rights or reputations of others, for the 
protection of national security, public order, or of public health or morals. Limitations 
must be prescribed by legislation necessary to achieve the desired purpose and 
proportionate to the need on which the limitation is predicated.   
 
These amendments engage and may limit the right to freedom of expression, which is 
protected by Article 19(2) of the ICCPR.   
 
Reasonable, necessary and proportionate amendments   
 
To the extent that the amendments relating to sponsorship limit freedom of expression 
it is for the legitimate objective of the protection of public health. The amendments 
expand the application of the provisions to include corporations in addition to 
individuals. This was the original intended application of the prohibition on the basis 
that the conduct should be widely prohibited.  
 
Advertising and sponsorship bans are an effective means to reduce the prevalence and 
initiation of tobacco use.2 The ban includes a broad range of media platforms, 
extending to social media for example, and other forms of advertising, promotion and 
sponsorship. It is important that the public’s exposure to advertising and promotion of 
tobacco products which pose a risk to population health is limited. The amendments 
to expand the application of the prohibition to corporations are reasonable.  
 
The expanded application of the sponsorship prohibition is proportionate to the public 
health risk posed.  
 
The amendments to expand the application of the prohibition limit the right to 
freedom of expression only to the extent necessary to achieve the objectives of the 
measures, specifically with the intention of discouraging the use of tobacco and 
e-cigarette- products and to protect and improve public health. It follows that the 
measures are proportionate and do not impinge on freedom of expression to a greater 
degree than is necessary. 
 
Australia’s history of progressively more comprehensive and stringent tobacco 
regulation is consistent with international best practice as well as steps to combat the 
global health epidemic posed by tobacco smoking through implementation of the 
WHO FCTC.    
 
The WHO FCTC imposes a comprehensive set of obligations for Parties to implement 
and manage tobacco control programmes. Article 13(2) obliges each Party “in 
accordance with its constitution or constitutional principles, [to] undertake a 
comprehensive ban of all tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship.” 
 
Under the WHO FCTC, tobacco advertising and promotion means any form of 
commercial communication, recommendation or action with the aim, effect or likely 
effect of promoting a tobacco product or tobacco use either directly or indirectly. It 
                                                 
2 Levy DT, Chaloupka F & Gitchell J. (2004) The effects of tobacco control policies on smoking rates: a tobacco control 
scorecard. Journal of Public Health Management & Practice, 10(4), 338–53. doi:10.1097/00124784-200407000-00011. 
28 
follows that the amendments in relation to the prohibition on tobacco advertising and 
sponsorship are necessary, consistent with Australia’s commitment to implementing 
the WHO FCTC and that there is not less restrictive means of achieving the desired 
ends.  
 
Similarly, equivalent advertising and sponsorship prohibitions applied to e-cigarettes 
are proportionate to the public health risk posed by e-cigarettes. The amendments 
harmonise the interaction with the Therapeutic Goods Act vaping goods advertising 
provisions.   
 
It follows that the amendments are reasonable given the international precedents, 
extensive public consultation and evidence base on which they have been developed. 
 
Right to a fair trial and fair hearing rights and right to a presumption of innocence 
 
The amendments engage the right to a fair trial and fair hearing rights along with the 
right to a presumption of innocence because they affect offence provisions. In 
particular, this is the case for the phase in and out provisions for tobacco product 
requirements and the amendment to expand the application of the sponsorship 
prohibition to corporations. The amendments also clarify the interaction between the 
Tobacco Act and the Therapeutic Goods Act prohibition on advertising of vaping 
goods.  
 
The Tobacco Act triggers the operation of the Regulatory Powers Act. The safeguards 
of Part 4 of the Regulatory Powers Act apply to ensure that fair process is applied, 
particularly where there is the potential for both criminal and civil proceedings.   
 
To the extent that the amendments engage with the right to a fair trial and fair hearing 
rights and also the right to a presumption of innocence, any limitations on these rights 
are reasonable, necessary and proportionate. The amendments are reasonable because 
they seek to clarify the application of the law and provide an effective regulatory 
regime. The amendments are necessary and proportionate as they are in furtherance of 
the important objects of the Tobacco Act. 
 
Conclusion 
 
The Bill is compatible with human rights because it promotes and supports the right to 
health and other rights and, to the extent that it limits other rights, the limitations are 
reasonable, necessary and proportionate.

HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (IMPROVED MEDICARE 
INTEGRITY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2024 
 
NOTES ON CLAUSES 
 
Clause 1 – Short Title 
 
This clause provides for the short title of the Act, once enacted, to be the Health 
Legislation Amendment (Improved Medicare Integrity and Other Measures) Act 2024. 
 
Clause 2 – Commencement 
 
This clause sets out when the Bill measures commence. Sections 1 to 3 commence on 
the day of Royal Assent. The measures in Schedule 1 have various commencement 
arrangements, and the measures in Schedules 2 and 3 commence the day after Royal 
Assent.  
 
Clause 3 – Schedules 
 
This clause provides that each Act that is specified in a Schedule to this Bill is 
amended or repealed as set out in the applicable items in the Schedule concerned, and 
any other item has effect according to its terms. 
 
This is a technical provision which gives operational effect to the amendments 
contained in the Schedules. 
 
Schedule 1 amends the Dental Benefits Act 2008, Health Insurance Act 1973, 
Human Services (Medicare) Act 1973 and National Health Act 1953. 
 
Schedule 2 amends the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. 
 
Schedule 3 amends the Public Health (Tobacco and Other Products) Act 2023. 
  
30 
SCHEDULE 1 — MEDICARE INTEGRITY AMENDMENTS 
 
Part 1—Amendments relating to timeframe for bulk-billed claims 
 
Division 1—Amendments commencing the day after royal assent 
 
Dental Benefits Act 2008 
 
Item 1 – Subsection 15(2) 
 
This item changes the timeframe for claims relating to assigned dental benefits to be 
made from 2 years to 1 year unless the Chief Executive Medicare has allowed a 
longer period. 
 
An assigned dental benefit involves a person transferring their right to the payment of 
a dental benefit to a provider who accepts the assignment as full payment for the 
expenses incurred in respect of a dental service. This practice is commonly known as 
“bulk billing”. When a service is bulk-billed, the dental provider is not allowed to 
charge the person an additional fee for the dental service. 
 
Subsection 15(2) currently allows a claim for an assigned dental benefit to be made up 
to 2 years after a service is rendered. 
 
The legislation currently enables a person to make an application for a longer period 
to make a claim for dental benefit and this provision will not change. 
 
This change is likely to have minimal impact on patients and dental providers as most 
claims for dental benefit are already made within 1 year. 
 
Item 2 – Application provision 
 
This item provides that these amendments apply to claims for a dental benefit in 
respect of a dental service rendered on or after the commencement of this Division. 
 
Division 2—Contingent amendments if amendments relating to assignment of 
medicare benefits have not yet commenced 
 
Health Insurance Act 1973 
 
Item 3 – Paragraph 20B(2)(b) 
 
This item changes the timeframe for making claims relating to some assigned 
medicare benefits from 2 years to 1 year unless the Minister has allowed a longer 
period. 
 
An assigned medicare benefit involves a person transferring their right to the payment 
of a medicare benefit to a practitioner who accepts the assignment as full payment for 
the expenses incurred in respect of a service. This practice is commonly known as 
"bulk billing”. When a service is ”bulk-billed”, the practitioner is not allowed to 
charge the person an additional fee for the relevant service. 
31 
 
Section 20B(2) currently allows a claim for an assigned medicare benefit to be made 
up to 2 years after a professional service is rendered. 
 
Changing the timeframe for making of these claims to 1 year will improve the 
integrity of payments. 
 
The change is likely to have minimal impact on patients and practitioners as most 
claims for medicare benefit are already made within 1 year. The legislation currently 
enables a person to make an application for a longer period to make a claim for 
medicare benefit and this provision will not change. 
 
The changes will not affect claims for benefits assigned or taken to have been 
assigned under subsection 20A(2A), which may continue to be made within 2 years 
following the date of service. 
 
Item 4 – Subsection 20B(3A) 
 
This item refers to the discretion of the Minister to consider applications for claims 
relating to assigned medicare benefits to be made outside the usual timeframe. 
 
This item will remove the reference to the current 2-year period for a claim to be 
made because this timeframe will now be one year unless the Minister has allowed a 
longer period. 
 
Item 5 – Subsection 20B(3B) 
 
This item changes the terminology in subsection 20B(3B) to refer to the “making” 
rather than the “lodging” of claims. This is consistent with the terminology used in 
subsection 20B(3A). 
 
Item 6 – Application provision 
 
This item provides that these amendments apply to claims for medicare benefits in 
respect of professional services rendered on or after the commencement of this 
Division. 
 
Division 3—Amendments commencing when Division 1 and amendments 
relating to assignment of medicare benefits have both commenced 
 
Health Insurance Act 1973 
 
Item 7 – Paragraph 20B(1)(c) 
 
This item repeals and replaces paragraph 20B(1)(c) to change the timeframe for 
claims relating to bulk billing assignments from 2 years to one year unless the 
Minister has allowed a longer period under subsection (3A). 
 
The Health Legislation Amendment (Assignment of Medicare Benefits) Act 2024 will 
commence 18 months after Royal Assent unless proclaimed first. This Act will amend 
32 
section 20A to set out differences between bulk billing assignments of benefits, and 
simplified billing assignments of benefits. 
 
Simplified billing assignments remove the need for an assignment between an eligible 
person and a private health insurer, approved billing agent or other person and enables 
3 methods by which Medicare benefits can be taken to be pre-assigned. 
 
The change in timeframe for the making of claims only applies to bulk billing 
assignments of benefits not simplified billing assignments of benefits. This item will 
ensure that the changes only apply to bulk billing assignments after the 
commencement of the Health Legislation Amendment (Assignment of Medicare 
Benefits) Act 2024. The timeframe for claims involving simplified billing assignments 
will remain 2 years unless the Minister has allowed a longer period under 
subsection(3A). 
 
Item 8 – Application provision 
 
This item provides that these amendments apply to claims for Medicare benefits in 
respect of professional services rendered on or after the commencement of this 
Division. 
 
Part 2—Amendments relating to criminal offences 
 
Human Services (Medicare) Act 1973 
 
Item 9 – Section 3A 
 
This item will replace the section and the multiple definitions of “relevant offence” 
with a single uniform definition. This will enable a broader and more consistent use of 
the investigative powers contained in Part IID of the Human Services (Medicare) Act. 
 
The investigative powers in Part IID include notices to produce information or 
documents (Division 2), searches of premises with the occupier’s consent 
(Division 3), and search and seizure powers under a warrant (Division 4). 
 
An “authorised officer” (appointed by signed instrument) can exercise these 
investigative powers. To exercise the powers, the authorised officer must have a 
reasonable suspicion that a ‘relevant offence’ is being, or has been, committed. 
 
Section 3A provides that “relevant offence” means something different for each of 
Divisions 2 and 3 and the remainder of the legislation, with each definition 
incorporating a specific list of offences. Therefore, whether an authorised officer can 
exercise a power in relation to a suspected offence depends on whether that offence is 
a “relevant offence” for the purposes of that power. 
 
In 1994, when the section was introduced, the separate definitions were intended to 
make a distinction between “those offences involving fraud which might result in a 
provider being excluded from the Medicare Program” and all other Medicare-related 
fraud offences. Amendments arising from changes to other legislation (such as the 
Crimes Act 1914 (Crimes Act) and Criminal Code) have not been applied consistently 
33 
to this section. This has resulted in arbitrary gaps in the ability to exercise 
investigative powers. 
 
Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme 
The investigative powers are much more limited in relation to the Pharmaceutical 
Benefits Scheme (PBS) than they are in respect of Medicare. For example: 
 
• the power to execute a search warrant applies to any offence in the Health 
Insurance Act, but only to offences in Part VII of the National Health Act; 
  
• the power to issue a coercive notice, or to search a premises with consent, only 
applies to very limited provision (subsections 84L(1) and (2) and section 103) 
of the National Health Act; and 
 
• an authorised officer cannot investigate Criminal Code offences relating to 
suspected PBS fraud. 
 
Further, Criminal Code offences are only available where the suspected fraud relates 
to a dental service, professional service, indemnity scheme payment or 
Commonwealth contribution. 
 
In practice this means that an authorised officer can issue a coercive notice or search a 
premises with consent if a suspected Criminal Code offence (for example, obtain 
financial advantage by deception contrary to section 134.2(1)) relates to Medicare 
claims. However, if the potential fraud relates to PBS claims, the authorised officer 
cannot investigate an offence contrary to section 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code. 
 
These limitations significantly impact the Department’s ability to appropriately 
respond to high value potential PBS fraud matters. 
 
Criminal Code offences 
There is currently no power in Part IID to execute a search warrant or seize material 
in relation to suspected Criminal Code fraud offences. Instead, the only powers that 
may be used in relation to suspected Criminal Code offences are: 
 
• the issue of a notice to produce (akin to a coercive notice power and cannot 
produce admissible evidence for use in any subsequent prosecution); and 
 
• the power to search a premises with the occupier’s consent only, and only in 
relation to suspected offending that has occurred within the last 60 days – 
which is such a narrow window that this power can rarely be used. 
 
This is resulting in practical difficulties. In particular, Criminal Code offences cannot 
be prosecuted where evidence has been seized using a search warrant under the 
Human Services (Medicare) Act. 
 
In cases where Criminal Code charges are anticipated, officers must arrange for a 
warrant under section 3E of the Crimes Act (in consultation with the Australian 
Federal Police (AFP)). When this has not been anticipated in advance, evidence 
34 
obtained via a warrant under the Human Services (Medicare) Act must be returned 
and re‑seized under a Crimes Act warrant. 
 
These difficulties are confusing and burdensome. Additionally, the AFP’s resource 
constraints and competing law enforcement priorities can have a significant adverse 
impact on timeframes for investigation and eventual prosecution of Medicare and PBS 
fraud cases. 
 
These gaps and inconsistencies may result in situations where a prosecution using 
Criminal Code offences is not possible, or where less serious offences in the health 
legislation are charged instead. 
 
These limitations significantly impact the ability to appropriately respond to high 
value potential PBS fraud matters to protect the integrity and sustainability of health 
benefits schemes. 
 
The single uniform definition of relevant offence will enable the investigative powers 
in Part IID to be used consistently in respect of health benefits schemes and in relation 
to a broader range of Criminal Code offences. 
 
Specifically, a single overarching definition will enable the investigation of an offence 
that relates to: 
• claims for payment in respect of a professional service, dental service or the 
supply or purported supply of a pharmaceutical benefit; 
• an indemnity scheme payment; or 
• a Commonwealth contribution (within the meaning of the Midwife 
Professional Indemnity (Commonwealth Contribution) Scheme Act 2010). 
  
A single definition of relevant offence will also enable the investigation of an offence 
against the Divisions of the Criminal Code relating to fraudulent conduct, false or 
misleading statements, bribery and related offences, forgery and related offences, 
identity fraud and money laundering. 
 
These changes will allow investigative powers to be used consistently and effectively 
across all health schemes, including Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits 
Scheme. They will also enable the powers to be used in the investigation of Criminal 
Code offences. 
 
Criminal Code offences are appropriate in serious cases, involving significant fraud 
over extended periods. This change will also remove the need for AFP assistance with 
executing warrants for suspected Criminal Code offences and improve the powers to 
investigate suspected offending for all health schemes. 
 
Item 10 – Subsection 8U(1) 
 
This item will amend section 8U to remove the reference to a suspected offence being 
committed “within the previous 60 days”. 
 
35 
Currently, the power to search a premises with consent is subject to a 60-day 
timeframe. That is, the suspected offending must have taken place within the last 60 
days. 
 
This is a short timeframe which places a significant impediment on conducting 
effective investigations. This is because in some cases 60 days is not long enough for 
fraud to be detected or reported, and for an investigation to be commenced. Further, 
60 days does not allow a long enough period for an authorised officer to have the 
ability or opportunity to attend at the premises. This time limit does not apply in 
relation to Divisions 2 or 4 of the legislation and impacts an authorised officer’s 
ability to enter a premises with consent for suspected past offending. 
 
Removing the time limitation will make this provision consistent with section 8P, 
relating to the issue of notice, and section 8Y relating to search warrants. These 
provisions have no such time limitation on suspected offending. 
 
This expansion of the timeframe is reasonable and proportionate for the purpose of 
being able to enforce the relevant offences, noting the practical reality of time delays 
in reporting and detecting fraud and commencing investigations. 
 
Item 11 – Paragraph 8ZG(3)(d) 
 
This item will amend section 8ZG to introduce an option for data copied at warrant 
premises to be returned to the occupier of the premises at that time, instead of having 
to be destroyed. 
 
Currently some potential evidential material, including copies of documents in 
electronic form, is required to be destroyed (rather than returned) if the reason for 
copying the data no longer exists or a decision has been made not to use the data in 
evidence. 
 
If an authorised officer (investigator) suspects on reasonable grounds that the data 
accessed by operating that electronic equipment constitutes evidential material, they 
may copy that data to another device. However, any copy of that data must be 
destroyed if the reason for copying the data no longer exists or a decision has been 
made not to use the data in evidence. Therefore, the reproduction of the material 
under the control of investigators must be destroyed. 
 
This results in the destruction of potentially highly relevant evidence, without an 
option to return the material and re-seize it under section 3E of the Crimes Act. In 
some circumstances, even if the data still exists at the warrant premises, a defendant 
may have removed or concealed it between the copy being destroyed and a Crimes 
Act warrant being executed. 
 
This means that in some situations, electronic evidence may be destroyed rather than 
returned and re-seized. This can mean losing valuable evidence and potentially 
undermining an ongoing investigation. If copied data is not to be used as evidence, it 
can also result in an occupier of the premises having no opportunity to have copied 
data returned. 
 
36 
Amended paragraph 8ZG(3)(d) will require the disposal of the copied data but will 
enable this to take place via either return or destruction. In other words, the disposal 
can involve either the return of the reproduction to a person who is an occupier of the 
premises or the destruction of the reproduction. 
 
This is consistent with the return of other evidential material that is currently 
permissible under section 8ZM, as well as with the Attorney-General’s Department 
Guide to Framing Commonwealth Offences, Infringement Notices and Enforcement 
Powers. This generally refers to the return of seized material, although in the context 
of original material rather than reproductions. In circumstances where the material is 
copied, and the current situation only allows for destruction, there is no need to 
implement a time limit for return. 
 
Under amended paragraph 8ZG(3)(d), the copied data could either be returned to a 
person who is the occupier of the premises at that time, or destroyed. There is no 
presumption given to either return or destruction as the circumstances of copied data 
means that there is not necessarily an owner in the same way there would be for 
original material seized, and it may also not immediately be clear whether the original 
data is still available. As a result, both options need to be available to ensure the 
copied data is appropriately dealt with. 
 
Item 12 – Paragraph 8ZGA(3)(d) 
 
This item will amend section 8ZGA to introduce an option for data copied from 
electronic equipment found at warrant premises to be returned to the occupier of the 
premises at that time, instead of having to be destroyed. 
 
Currently some potential evidential material, including copies of documents in 
electronic form, is required to be destroyed (rather than returned) if the reason for 
copying the data no longer exists or a decision has been made not to use the data in 
evidence. 
 
If an investigator suspects on reasonable grounds that data accessed by operating 
electronic equipment found at the warrant premises constitutes evidential material, 
they may copy that data to another device. However, any copy of that data must be 
destroyed if the reason for copying the data no longer exists or a decision has been 
made not to use the data in evidence. Therefore, the reproduction of the material 
under the control of investigators must be destroyed. 
 
This results in the destruction of potentially highly relevant evidence, without an 
option to return the material and re-seize it under section 3E of the Crimes Act. In 
some circumstances, even if the data still exists at the warrant premises, a defendant 
may have removed or concealed it between the copy being destroyed and a Crimes 
Act warrant being executed. 
 
This means that in some situations, electronic evidence may be destroyed rather than 
returned and re-seized. This can mean losing valuable evidence and potentially 
undermining an ongoing investigation. If copied data is not to be used as evidence, it 
can also result in an occupier of the premises having no opportunity to have copied 
data returned.

Amended paragraph 8ZGA(3)(d) will require the disposal of the copied data. 
However, this disposal will involve either return or destruction. In other words, the 
disposal can involve either the return of the reproduction to a person who is an 
occupier of the premises or the destruction of the reproduction. 
 
This is consistent with the return of other evidential material that is currently 
permissible under section 8ZM, as well as with the Attorney-General’s Department 
Guide to Framing Commonwealth Offences, Infringement Notices and Enforcement

original material seized, and it may also not immediately be clear whether the original 
data is still available. As a result, both options need to be available to ensure the 
copied data is appropriately dealt with. 
 
Item 13 – Application provisions  
 
The amendments to the definition of relevant offence will apply to the investigation of 
conduct (including an omission) which relates to a relevant offence, whether the 
conduct occurs before, on or after commencement. This will enable investigative 
powers to be used to investigate conduct that relates to a relevant offence, regardless 
of whether that conduct was within the definition of “relevant offence” at the time it 
took place. 
 
It is important to note, however, that no new offences are being created and the 
underlying offences themselves are not being changed. As a result, no retrospective 
criminal liability is created. Instead, the ame
